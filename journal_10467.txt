I'm loading my pack and thinking of Lewis & Clark. Hell, how do you pack for an 5,000-plus march into the unknown? Start with alot of meat, apparently: the Corps packed "a ton of dried pork." Maybe I should bring a baggy of deer jerky.
Food, fuel, shoes, and H20 aside, here's my gear list so far. Keep in mind, I'm going "ultra-light", which basically means I'm trying really hard to keep my pack as light as possible. Duh, right? That's called "common sense", not "ultra-light". Either way, I've slashed significant poundage, leaving my total weight at a skimpy 13.8 lbs! 
Anyways, please, give me feedback! Too much? Too little? Missing something?

# Saturday, February 06, 2010 — Hike Inn
**Start Location:** Amicalola Falls State Park
**Miles Today:** 0
**Trip Miles:** 0

In the darkness we trudged on without words. After a late start, at 3:45pm, the trail took us up Amicalola Falls and higher into Frosty Mountain as dusk drew near. And Frosty it was, thanks to an ice storm that blew in the previous night, leaving the forest glassy and white. The ices thawed, shattered down from the trees overhead, and buried the trail in 2 inches of shards. Rain had fallen below at Amicalola State Park HQ where we set off, but up here the world was gripped in ice. the foul weather slowed progress - not only did we have to march through ice but detour around splintered branches and trees fallen across the trail. So by nightfall, there I was. Trudging by flashlight along the blue-blazed "approach trail", feeling tired of walking even before the white blazes began. 
I expected a damp and dismal shelter that night, but we stumbled across a glowing refuge in the middle of the woods: The Hiker Inn. the situation that night was by no means an emergency, but with my Dad and Morgan it seemed like one for some reason. Morgan was having knee problems and looked on the verge of tears, branches and trees were falling all around us, my hands were numb and it was pitch black for a cloud-covered moon. Emergency or not, we saw a trail sign for The Hiker Inn and decided to pull off. I expected a cold night on the front porch or in an old shed. What I found was a lone innkeeper offering a lamp-lit dwelling warmed by woodstove. All's well that ends well.
Let's go back to where it all begins, to my weeping mother by the car in front of the house. I forget sometimes, how much I mean to people. I forget that I have the power to bring great joy and great sadness, that me going actually matters to someone. So when I put my arms around my mother and she started to cry, I was filled with this incredible sense that I was home, the only place in the world where I really mean something. There I was crucial. I guess it all comes back to love, something I've never really been able to put into words. All I can do is point to my mother and father, my two best friends in the whole world, without whom I would just be a scared little boy. They've brought me here. They've made me a man. and although I didn't think any of this at the time, it was painted so perfectly as I held my weeping mother by the car.
That night we drove to South Carolina and stayed at a hotel. I stayed up late that night reading Thoreau out of my sister's Lit book. He rambles alot, but I liked the marrow part: "When I would recreate myself, I seek the darkest wood and most interminable swamp, and enter it as a sacred place, a sanctum sanctorum. Three is strength, the marrow of nature." I'm about to enter a dark season on an interminable trail, I said to myself, so the suffering is all to shine on that marrow. there is the heart of God. We ate at Cracker Barrel at 6:30 the next morning and then drove to Springer Mountain, "Southern Terminus to the Applachian Trail". I fell asleep in the backseat and awoke to the Amicalola State Park HQ, gateway to the Springer Mountain trail. I registered, weighed my pack, and hit the blue-blazed approach trail to the Springer's summit. 8.8 miles. It was 3:45pm. the trail led into ice, night fell, and we ended up in The Hikers Inn warm log-cabin lobby. We met Stanley, the innkeeper and former A.T. thru-hiker himself, who started up the wood stove and offered me advice for my own hike. I was so fortunate to be there with my father and sister, really enjoying our time together. That was the only thing on my mind that night before I began my 2,000 mile trek to Maine.

We parted ways at 10:00am. My father and sister walked out the door like I’ve seen them do so many times this past month, but this time I wouldn’t wee them return that evening. This was different. It was hard saying goodbye at what I knew was an exit from their lives for the next six months, before I’d go off and live my life and they’d go off and live theirs. As they walked out the door and out of view, I felt just about as lonely as I’d ever felt. I kind of wanted to chase them but that would be too embarrassing. So I sat there, trying to nap but unable. I think it was because I was alone now and knew it, making me uncomfortable and on edge. From here on out it’ll be like that, more or less, with my guard up full-time. I need to stop writing about this or it’ll get to me.
By 10:30 I was at it, trudging through the aftermath of the ice storm, slipping and sliding in the snow and ice and trying not to yell curse words at the huge limbs blocking the trail. It was slow and painful to the summit of Springer Mountain, by 1:00 I was there, wiping snow off the plaque that read, “Southern Terminus of the Appalachian Trail”. It was too cold and windy to relish the moment, so I marched down to the gap for a break. From there to the shelter, elevation decreased and trail conditions improved. No more ice. No more debris to climb over. Just 2” of snow to stomp down. My spirits immediately brightened as well.
At a shelter, I took a nap and ate. It was only 3:00 by then, so I decided to hoof it to the next shelter, 5.5 miles away. This leg turned out to be in perfect shape. I shot through at a steady 3 mph, descending into an amazing ravine of rhododendron and amazing old growth hemlocks. Some were 300 years old and 5 feet thick, I later learned. 
Walking through those holy trees was the highlight of my day. I reached Hawk Mountain shelter before sundown, totaling 9 miles that day. I ran down to the stream to get water, cooked, strung up a bear bag, and wrote for an hour by candlelight. I drifted off and had a strange demon dream where Satan was in my head and barking at me so I couldn’t think, and then I flooded him out by begging God to intervene and jerked awake. After that I was spooked and couldn’t drift off. The mice, in their audacious fashion, ran all over me and all over my stuff, flatly ignoring both my yells and the beams of my flashlight. I slept well that night.

**Start Location:** Hawk Mountain Shelter

I woke up at 8:30 and saw a huge red woodpecker which made me smile. By 9:15, I was on the trail strong and fast to my destination 20 miles away. The trail was gradual and I was happy to be on it, hoofing towards Maine. About an hour passed wuntil I realized I was going in the wrong direction. I cursed aloud. I cursed aloud again. And you know how I realized it? “Cool, that guy’s shoe tracks look just like mine. I wonder if he has the same ….oh shit.”
So after logging a total of 6 idiot miles, I was once again back at the shelter. It was 11:15. I took a nap had breakfast, dressed a blister, then set off again towards the next shelter 8 miles away (I gave up on 20 miles after losing so much daylight). And this time I was going North.
Still, the mountain was white out – all white in snow, fog, and sky – and the temperature was still 23F from that morning. But very quickly, the bad weather lifted. The sky cleared, temperatures rose, and somehow the trail was 100% cleared for the nearly all 8 miles. The sun out and surrounding mountains visible, I stopped for a second and though about how they chase the phrase “Appalachian Scenic Trail”: this was no forced march like I’d been treating it that day. It was a scenic route, carved for the likes of Thoreau’s saunterer traveling to the Holy Land. Then I thought of how fortunate I was to be there on that mountain. I could’ve been a lot of other places – like stuck at work or school, in a wheelchair, or in the twisted metal of a car on the side of River Road- like should’ve happened so many times. So here’s to a blessing. “I’m goin’ to Maine!” I said laughing. “I’m goin’ to Maine!”
At dusk, at the shelter, I finished dinner and let the fire die down to dull embers. In his classic hiker’s manual, The Walker’s Handbook, Colin Fletcher let it die from time to time, to let the darkness surround you. There’s nothing as pure and powerful he said, as darkness deep in the woods. So I stood on the porch of the shelter and let everything go black around me. The wind blew in the trees and it was eerily quiet. “Say something” I said to God. I didn’t know whether to expect something good to happen or something bad, because I’ve found that he’s speaking all the time in the strangest ways, and he’s found in both the happy and the hard. I stood there for a long time, dreaming not thinking about all the blackness. It was addicting. It cozied the mind and numbed it over, like the way you cease when you finally arrive home. I was at home, in the wooded blackness. After half an hour, I retired to my sleeping bag and fell asleep.

# Tuesday, February 09, 2010 — Neel Gap Hostel
**Start Location:** Gooch Mountain Shelter
**Miles Today:** 15.50
**Trip Miles:** 38.50

In the morning, I awoke before 8:00 and prepared to leave. It was very cold, but off I went towards Neels Gap. After several hours I passed through Woody Gap, where I met a middle-aged couple on a geo mission. The man took my photo with his iphone and emailed it to my mom and dad. They lady kept looking at me like she wished she had a son of her own. My first run in with Trail Magic!
It was 11:00 and I continued on up to the ominously titled Blood Mountain. Cherokee and Creek warriors met head to head on these slopes, leaving so many dead that the streams ran red with blood. On the way up, I passed homeless and unemployed, two 2001 thru-hikers on a stroll for the day. Two of the nicest hippies I’ve ever met. The man really wanted to give me tips and advice and the woman was beaming at me the whole time. I’m not entirely sure why, but that couple filled me up with so much positive energy.
Down into the next gap, I began to micro-nap. I don’t know how long it lasted, but I continued to twist my ankle and walk off the trail, and even hallucinate (I saw my dad’s face in a poplar tree, even double-taking to make sure) until, at last, I threw down my pack and collapsed trailside for a deep, hour long nap.
Blood Mountain wasn’t too difficult. It climbed up and over several false summits and finally wound up into a rocky, rhododendron covered peak. The wind was steady and snow was still on the ground. I Exploded off the trail and shot down the mountain (small birds for once played in the rhododendron). I found cougar tracks. An ornery, cantankerous skunk was said to occupy the mountaintop shelter, and a bear had reportedly been “hanging out” around the summit. To accentuate the sense of wildness was the narrow trail itself, which tunneled through the rhododendron and crawled over mossy rocks. On the summit’s main rocky outcrop, I saw the entire North Georgia Mountains rolling out and a pink and purple sunset over them. The CCC constructed shelter, a 2 room stone edifice complete with windows and a fireplace. Still, drafts of cold wind kept the shelter far from cozy, so I gambled on finding a free place to stay and moved on down the mountain to Neels Gap.
I reached Neels Gap outfitter by 5 o’clock, closing time, but fortunately the Hiker Hostel was open. There were several men milling about, all with foot-long gray beards and long hair. A long beard means one thing in the mountains - experience- so, naturally, I was excited to spend a night with the experts. The price was only $15, said one bearded man, with the possibility of working it off. I sat down inside and wrote while another bearded man prepared tacos and rambled on about how “everything was going to shit” thanks to an enforcement of state ordinances. Two more bearded men walked in the door and dissappeared out the back. “Can you shoot a cougar?” I asked. “Sure, I don’t see why not. But if they catch you they’ll throw you in jail”, said one of the gnarliest of the bunch. Then he let out a long calm laugh and started talking to the cats. “Come get dinner,” he said after awhile, “or the cats’ll get to it. Actually, they already have.” He laughed at that.
After dinner I boiled some tea and sat by the heater to write in my journal. In ten minutes I was curled up in the chair asleep. It was so nice being warm.

In the morning I got up at 6:15 to get a hot shower before the others did, then sat by the heater and read a book about trees. At 9:00, I packed up, and walked up to the outfitters. I asked to do some work to pay off my stay, but the owner wasn’t there so I settled up to save time. I hit the trail just before 10, just as the rains came.
That day was divided sharply between great and God-awful. The first half, the great part, flew past as I hoofed without stopping through the wind and rain. 6 miles over to Tesnatee Gap. I went hard and strong and felt like a champ. But after a short stop at Tesnatee, things fell apart. During the stop, I’d quickly lost all doby and hand heart and became a numb-fingered, shivering - and , not to mention, dripping wet – mess. My hands lost the benign feeling of numbness and began to hurt like someone was bending them back. Groaning aloud and cursing, I began to march. I won’t go into details because the next 4 hours was a drama of the most boring kind. I’ll just say it really sucked and skip to the moment with God, which occurred near the end of the ordeal. I was mouthing off at him again (aloud, mind you), not really making a case but just pissed at the day’s suffering. I had to yell at someone. I told h im to make it okay, or at least give me the big picture so I could at least calm down. All of the sudden, I said it aloud, “This is all part of it”. This is part of the Good, the adventure, the chase after an elusive Spirit. This very moment of numb hands, wet clothes and stabbing blisters was the very reason I set off. Because this is Thoreau’s “marrow of life”, and in it I will find my God.
I went to sleep that night with no idea what to do about my blisters for the next day. The wind picked up and a fog rolled in and the night was all dense blackness and I thought to myself about the old proverb “When I saw I stumbled.”

That was a rough night. The temperature plummeted, freezing to rock everything in the shelter I thought was safe – my water bottles, my boots, my clothes. Snow flurries blew in while I slept and covered my down sleeping bag, soaking into the goosedown inside and forming a shell of ice on the surface. As a result, my feet went numb. I awoke cold and discouraged. I fumbled with numb hands to gather my gear and apply my moleskin. My boots were too frozen to put on so I screamed at God in the ravine “What the hell am I supposed to do??” I put on my down booties and started walking.
To my surprise, the down booties did an excellent job. By the time I reached the Blue Mountain Shelter, I had marched through 8 miles of snow and ice and my feet felt great. Close to the summit the wind blasted through the trees. It filled the ears like deafening static. “C’mon! C’mon!” I yelled exhilarated by the struggle against the elements. At the summit shelter, I found an old-timer with his dog and Kevin, a young thru-hiker. “Fire!”, I said, seeing the wind ripping smoke out of the fire pit. “How’d you pull that off?” Kevin was knelt by the fire. He grinned like it was no big deal. “Sticks and fire”. Then he laughed. “Respect”, I said, I asked for more details. The old-timer had a long beard and a weathered face. He was smoking a Backwoods cigar. As it were, the two were holed up in the shelter because the next peak on the trail, Tray Mountain, was demolished by a terrible ice storm. The trail was impassable, said the old-timer; he had tried. The company was nice, especially by two with more knowledge of mountain survival than I. “So where’d you learn to make a fire in the snow?”, I asked. Kevin had been a hunting guide in British Columbia for half of the year, for the past six years, and had “pulled out bodies” from the snow many times. I told him of the previous night’s problems and asked for advice, “The learning curve in the cold is steep, bro” he said grinning. He was really impressed by my light pack. “Hats off to you, mate. Especially in cold weather.”
I gave Kevin some cheese, warmed my hands up by the fire, and marched on down to Unicoi Gap to hitch into town. Dry gear and a warm motel were in high demand. After a minute of thumbing a black car pulled over. Alex, a gay artist on his way to see his boyfriend, was glad to drive me around town to check various motel prices. He was “paying back a favor, or paying it forward, whichever one” He said in his hometown, Hayesville, NC, alcohol had just become legal last month. He had been a vocal advocate. His father, a Baptist minister, had led the opposition. I laughed. Alex said goodbye at the EconoLodge, and I fell asleep on my $30/night bed. I woke up, took a shower, called home, and ate some shrimp ramen with tuna and olive oil. Everyone seemed fine at home, like they’d moved on without me as I’m accustomed to them doing. When you’re away, all you can really say is “I love you” or “I miss you” but those words don’t mean much. It still kinda sucks. I thought about that while I ate my ramen. That night I watched a cheesy movie about aliens. I just didn’t feel like writing.

At 6:15 the next morning, I was packing my gear up. It was all so warm and dry. I wrote until 7 o’clock then went to breakfast. Ron, the on-duty manager, was fiddling around with setting up breakfast. He rambled on about how dismal Richmond was for various reasons, including one story about two hookers begging him for crack money. Another story involved drug-running and leaving town after a 6’5” friend fooled around with some other guy’s girlfriend. “I gotta ask you something”, he said. “Are you carrying a gun?”
After breakfast, I dressed my blisters. I bought moleskin at Randy’s pharmacy and the lady let me sit inside to apply it. Randy gave me free blister tape: Trail Magic! “Stay as long as you want, I’d let you lay out and take a nap if we still had those mattresses!”
I walked out to the road and stuck out my thumb. Believe it or not, Ron pulled over. He rambled about me burning ukp all his gas money, running a homeless shelter, how “he don’t pay me shit” at his job and the yars he spent with black ops in Vietnam. “I help people like you out because of what I done to all them”, he said looking skyward. “You wouldn’t believe the sniper rifles they got these days,” he said next. Ron was a good man, a wreck but worth every penny. I’m glad I met him. “I can’t afford to burn all this gas,” he said. “But I need to get up into these mountains. It’s beautiful”. I got out and slammed the door at the trailhead. He rolled down his window and yelled for me. “Hey, hey…I’ve gotta ask you a question.” “Do you ever see things up there that you’d never see down here?” I said “Yes, you do.”
That day on the trail was great. I passed one hiker after another, meeting and greeting and exchanging trail info. I first passed Ryan, another thru-hiker. He’d been laid off, but luckily gotten into law school, and, with his wife’s permission, took off on the A.T. during the layover. He had a nice North Carolina draw. “I’m one of those slow, deliberate people”, he said as I passed. “Yeah,” I laughed. “You’ll probably pass me napping in the next shelter”. Next, I passed three sturdy men moving in the opposite direction. They were older, yet were “tougher than your average weekenders” as they assured, and seemed it. They were impressed by my ultralight pack. On my way up Tray Mountain, I passed an older fellow coming down. Dave Herring was in his 60’s and still climbing Georgia’s mountains, meeting up with thru-hikers and helping them along the way. A full-time Trail Angel, you might say. Today, he escorted two thru-hikers up and over Tray Mountain (remember, the trail was all but wiped out by the storm). For two separate nights, Dave had brought the hikers homecooked dinner, a warm bed, and a place to watch the Super Bowl. For three days, he had brought in two thru-hikers for hot meals, beds, and a Super Bowl party while icy conditions on Tray Mountain improved. Today, he escorted them up and over the mountain. He used to be a big runner, he said, but had lost cartilage in his knee. Now, he was down to just day-hiking for he and his wife. I was overwhelmed with gratitude for this man and his wife, for people who give themselves so fully to the strangers passing through. I’m talking about the A.T.’s host of Angels, and they’re watching over our road north.
After a long nap at the top of Tray, I passed two thru-hikers, Fauma and Second Stage, on the way down the mountain (when I say “down the mountain”, I’m referring t the many ups and downs between a summit and a gap. Rarely is there black-and-white ascent and descent on the AT). All day, I’d been tracking their prints through the snow and around the debris. Catching up to them was the climax of the day. “You hear about these hikers ahead of you and you read all their entries in the shelter journals. You start to paint a mental picture of them,” I told Fauma when I caught him. “It’s kinda like online dating.” He laughed, “Wow, guy”.
My eyes were set on Dicks Creek Gap, still 5.5 miles away by dusk. I flicked on my headlamp, chugged some orange juice and kept trucking. My legs were tired and my feet sore from walking in my booties for 8 miles already. I made it by 7:30 and hitched a ride into Hiawasee by 8pm. I got a motel room for $50 despite efforts at bargaining. I walked across the street to Hardee’s for dinner. I wrote, took a hot shower, and fell asleep by 11:00 with the lights on.

I woke up and caught the motel on fire. My alcohol stove liaks, you see, so when I placed it right outside the door of my second-story room it soaked the green carpet with alcohol. When I lit it, it exploded in a flame. I tried to blow it out to no avail. I knocked it over and flaming alcohol spilled out over more carpet. Flames were at least a foot high. I beat at it and finally got it under control, but the damage was done. The carpet was black and smoking. “Shit.” I said calmly. I quickly packed up my gear and got the hell out of there ASAP, tip-toeing over the office, down the steps, and one building down to a café.
As I sipped my coffee and wrote, I kept waiting for the motel owner to come looking for me. Afterall, in a small town one can’t run far. The café door would squeak open and I’d brace for confrontation, over and over again. “The cops are here for you”, I suddenly heard the barista tell a regular. I tensed. Maybe cops were turning into the motel parking lot, which the café shared, to hunt the fleeing vandal. And sure enough, three cops entered and stood by the door looking at me. “Can I help you officers?”, said the barista, and the officers sat down for a doughnut. I breathed out.
Looking over my shoulder, I crossed the street to the grocery store. I spent $33 for almost a week’s worth of food. Then I got a ride to the Blueberry Patch Hostel where the owner, Gary Potteat, turned me down at the driveway. “We’re just not finished yet. Maybe tomorrow.” He said kinda sorely. He’s a good Christian man who’s taken in thousands of hikers for no gain but ministry, so if he was sore I think it was because he had to turn down a hiker in need.
I had only 60 some dollars left, so another night at the motel was out of the question, even if I hadn’t fled the burned carpet that morning. I had no where to go.
The kind folks who gave me a ride (out of their way) to Blueberry Patch Hostel dropped me off at a church at the junction where they returned to their route to Atlanta to see their sick mother. I’ve always wanted to test out the church as a place of unconditional refuge, so I walked up to the office and knocked on the door. No answer. Just before walking back out to the road to thumb to another church, I noticed a small house on the corner of the church property. A pick-up was out front. I walked up and knocked, and to my surprise a younger man opened the door. He was hip-looking, sharp, kinda like a Young Life leader. “Let me see what I can do. Come on in.” I knelt down to pet the lab. “You know, I’m a thru-hiker back in 1996”. I couldn’t believe it. But the magic didn’t stop there. He said, “Follow me” and we walked over to the church. He flicked on the light in a room, “Wait in there and I’m gonna try to pull some strings,” he said, then disappeared. I read a bible for about five minutes, when a gleaming middle-aged woman walked in. “I’m Lynn”, she said. “I’m Gary’s wife, at the Blueberry Patch. We’re gonna get you a room in town.” I couldn’t believe it. Lynn, the gleaming secretary at the church, at which I fortuitously knocked, was the wife of the woner of the hostel where I’d just stopped, wife of a man who’s Christian kindness spread his name all the way to Richmond. And this connection was dropped in my lap by a sympathetic thru-hiking pastor. “We’re going to get you a room at Mull’s Motel”, she said. My stomach dropped. The burned carpet. That’s where I left the burned carpet. “Let me drive you to Mull’s” said the young pastor. We pulled in and I prepared for impact upon entering the cramped motel office. Fortunately, the 86 year old lady was still there in her nightgown, just like I’d seen her the evening before. And, (thanks to her age, perhaps) she didn’t remember me. I couldn’t believe it. I was redeemed. “I really don’t know how to thank you, man,” I said. “It just works out, doesn’t it”, he said. I think from time to time God has fun and wires things. Redemption of unbelievable cause-and-effect complexity. Even miracles. No, it’s not in his nature. It’s not all like that. Jesus spent but a sliver of his hours dropping jaws with these unbelievable occurances. Most of his days were spent walking around in the dust, telling people that, yeah..reality can be really boring but it’s okay. The miracles almost never happen around town but it doesn’t matter because the real miracle is deep within. The real wonder is the heart and soul of man. So, I won’t walk to Maine looking for him to wink at me again. I’ll keep looking within. 
Snow fell that night in Hiawasee, about 2 inches. I ate my trail mix and wrote oa letter to the Potteats from the warmth of my motel room. After two nights of comfort, I was ready to hit the trail again.

After a "zero day" off the trail, I awoke again in Mull's Motel and gathered my things. A lady saw me and asked if I needed any fuel of supplies. Yes, I said. I needed denatured alcohol for my stove. She pointed towards an outfitter down the street and told me to meet her there. "We got some for ya." She drove her truck around the corner, parked out front and opened the door and led me in. "It's free," she said, pointed towards some steel cans of alcohol. "Just leave a little something in the Kitty." I dropped a couple quarters in a cat-shaped container, thanked her, and hitched to the Blueberry Patch Hostel. The owner Gary Poteat still hadn't opened for the season, but I needed to pick up a package my parents had shipped there. Gary's house is off a 45 mph highway, miles from the city. It's easy to get a ride there from the city, but hitching away is difficult. A nice guy in a pick-up dropped me off there and drove away. Nobody was home so I waited, but I quickly realized it was too cold to hang around. Back to the trail was my only option. I left a note and walked out to the road. I stuck out my thumb and tried to look cold and miserable.The more cold and miserable you look, the more likely a car is to stop. I think. 
After almost 30 minutes, around the bend came a pickup. It was slowing and it's turn signal was on. It was Gary and his wife, Lynna, returning from town. They pulled in. "I know yall aren't open yet. I just need a package before I go," I quickly said as they got out. I wanted to make it clear that I just needed a package, not more charity. He said he had it and added, "You're welcome to stay the night." I pretended not to hear. If he really meant it, he'd repeat the offer. Sure enough, he did. "Yeah, I'd love to." This meant another day's delay, a second "zero", but I didn't care. This was an experience I wanted to have. Back in Richmond, I'd heard of Gary, his hostel, and even his hiker-famous blueberry pancakes. It was worth a day lost.
We chatted as he lit the wood stove in the bunkhouse. Gary was a talker, and told me some of his story in his cool, Georgia-accented voice. He thru-hiked in the 90's and felt the Lord's voice. "Open a hostel of your own," he heard. "Minister to hikers." He married, moved back to Georgia and bought a parcel off the AT. Ever since, he's taken in ragamuffin hikers like myself. I was the first of his 18th year.
The telephone rang and he walked over an answered it. Another hiker was on his way. Soon, a familiar face appeared at the door. Keven, the Canadian I'd met on Blue Mountain, walked in the door. He was thrilled to see me. I was glad to see him.
That night we went into Hiawasee. We bought food for the next stretch to Fontana Dam, a tedious process of diving out calories on price. Keven convinced me to share food together over the next two weeks--breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Sounded like a good idea. I mean, why not? We also got some steaks and asparagus to take back to cook. I bought a crispy Fuji apple. Back at the hostel, we ate heartily and stayed up until 1:00 dividing ten days of food weight.

# Monday, February 15, 2010 — Muskrat Creek Shelter
**Start Location:** Blueberry Patch Hostel
**Miles Today:** 15
**Trip Miles:** 93

We skipped church the next morning. The pastor of the Poteat's church, the Macedonian Baptist, had given me a ride into town and paid for a $50 motel room, and Gary Poteat had broken tradition and opened the hostel a day early just for me. I owed it to them to go to church and I knew it. But to make it 11 miles to the Muskrat Shelter by Sunday night, we needed to leave early. Kevin agreed. I still feel like I missed something by skipping church. I think He was waiting for me there, but I was too hasty to stop. We broke the news to Gary that night.
At 7:30 Sunday morning, I packed my pack and prepared to leave. Gary called us inside for a stellar breakfast of sausage, biscuts, eggs and pancakes with home-picked & home-made blueberry syrup. We held hands and prayed over the food, just like home. Gary prayed for us and I knew he (and Lynna) meant every word. It all warmed me up. Lynna gave us a hug before leaving, told us he'd be watching out. I've never meant a person that glowed so genuinely for Christ. You can't glow for God, I thought to myself, cus he's kinda mean. He's like the snow and ice. But you can glow for Christ. He's like the sunshine.
By 10:15 we were on the Trail, marching towards Maine. Just before the Muskrat Creek Shelter we crossed the North Carolina border. We celebrated and cursed Georgia. "Screw Georgia! We're in North Carolina!". Remember, all was buried in 1.5 feet of snow. Some drifts were even up to our thighs. After passing the gnarled oak in the clearing at Bly Gap, North Carolina greeted us with a grueling climb in 2-foot snow drifts. Very difficult. At Muskrat Creek, we found some food left by the previous night's campers. We played cards while we ate it for dinner. That night 4 inches of snow fell. Snowflakes drifted in and soaked into our down sleeping bags. I slept well.

# Tuesday, February 16, 2010 — Standing Indian Shelter
**Start Location:** Muskrat Creek Shelter
**Miles Today:** 5.30
**Trip Miles:** 98.30

The snowfall paralyzed the next day's movement. We packed up and ran down to Raven Rock, a side trail to a rocky outcropping over miles of open ridge & valley. The view was spectacular. Kevin pointed out a bear. I wasn't convinced.
A word on Kevin. He's good kid, 22 years-old and mild-mannered like myself. And like myself, his giggles and lightheartedness are clear stamps of loving parents and a comfortable, financially-stable home. Still, being with him is a challenge. It's Kevin in the morning and Kevin in the evening. We share shelter, food and water. We share the gratification of a long day's hike. We even share the silence of nightfall, which he prefers filling with dialogue. In a word, I'm sharing my great spiritual journey and it's irritating. I didn't hit the trail for company, to substitute "I" for "us" in my journaling. But the Spirit put him in here for a reason. To show me something or another.
The short 5.3-mile hike taxed our mind and body. We crawled along at about 1mph through the snow, inspiring each other with singing and joking. For hours we carried on, and arrived at the Standing Indian Shelter by dusk. We threw down our packs and searched for firewood. In 20 minutes a fire was blazing. It's amazing what a fire can do for spirits! "I'm not afraid of the night anymore," I said. "I'm not afraid of the cold." The fire smoked-out the shelter, sending us coughing out into the snow. It died down as we cooked tortillas with cheese over the flames. Beef stew for dinner. For some reason, Kevin got sick and I kinda had to take care of him in the cold. Up to that point, I'd kind of honored him as a senior, like a guide. But I realized then that I was better off alone. I was strong and independent.

**Start Location:** Standing Indian Shelter
**Miles Today:** 7.60
**Trip Miles:** 105.90

The next morning was 10 F in the shadow of Standing Indian Mountain. According to Cherokee legend, "a great winged monster once inhabited the mountain, and, during the monster's reign, warriors were posted on the mountain as lookouts." One day, a huge bold of lightening exploded on the mountain, killing the monster and striking the unfortunate warrior on-duty at the time. He was a lousy look-out, apparently. That's why he was struck and turned to stone. He's still there, a "Standing Indian" stone, but I didn't see it.
The sun was out and it was freezing. It had snowed another inch. Again, I had to wait for Kevin and ended up just leaving. We were both miserably cold. My feet were numb and patience low, but I brightened up the moment I started walking. That day flew by. We rolled into the shelter by 3:30 after nearly 8 miles of snow trudging. Fahma from Massachusetts was there. He'd taken the day off "I've been eatin' and drinkin' all day," he said. Running into Fahma was the highlight of the day. The night fell easier with him there to break the monotony of Kevin's voice. No offense to Kevin's voice. I'm just tired of it.
I asked Fahma about his family. He said he once had a son who thru-hike with him two years ago. "He had so much energy," he said. "He really got me through it". His son died last April of a brain tumor, and this hike was for him. According to Kevin, he paid for the Gooch Mountain Shelter I'd stayed in several nights before, in honor of his son. I recalled seeing a memorial photo on the wall. "This is for you, Tim", Fahma writes on every shelter journal. Lord, the baggage we carry so silently.

# Thursday, February 18, 2010 — Sapphire Inn (Franklin, NC)
**Start Location:** Carter Gap Shelter
**Miles Today:** 15.90
**Trip Miles:** 121.80

I left Kevin again that morning. That's how it'll probably always be: me leaving early and him catching up at the shelter at the end of the day. Because I'm with him morning and night, I cherish the days where it's just me and the trail. It's funny I use the words "me and the trail" when I sort of mean "me and God". Because that's kinda what he's like. Like a trail. 
The first several hours were painful. My feet burned and ached from numbness, and I groaned aloud. "My toes," I kept saying. "My toes hurt." Frostbite was a possibility, I thought, but I felt no tingling. Just numbness. I debated stopping and firing up my stove to thaw them out, but it was just too cold to stop. "And if I do get frostbite," I thought, "it's okay because I'm young." Still I was worried. I kept walking.
I took a side trail around Mount Albert, the official "emergency weather route". The moment I spotted an observation tower on it's summit I veered back onto the trail. An observation tower would be worth the difficulty. As expected, the rocky ascent was extremely precarious in the 2-foot snow drifts (I quickly learned that they offer "emergency weather" routes for a good reason). The tower was old and tired-looking and surrounded by dense rhododendron thicket. The wind blew. I climbed up to look out over the valley, spreading out for perhaps 50 miles. On the horizon hunched the Smokies, blue and ominous. A snowstorm obscured its peaks. I felt like Frodo, staring out to the black peaks of Mordor where my road would inevitably lead. Except this Mordor was blue and icy.
At about 2:00 I felt my toes for the first time that day, thanks to a gradual downhill that allowed me to pick up speed and get blood down to my feet. I gulped from a stream. I walked on. Time blurred and suddenly it was 4:00. I waited at the shelter for Kevin. 
Soon Kevin arrived, and we decided to move on to Franklin, 3.7 miles down the trail. After 5 days and 4 nights in the cold, we needed a night off. My feet were sore and stressed and I suspected some hairline fractures, but I kept on 'til we reached the highway. After 20 minutes of thumbing, a white pick-up pulled over. He was a skinny, tatooed young guy with a NC accent and Marlboro Red in his mouth.
He, his brother, his father, and even his grandfather--yeah, his grandfather!--all enlisted in the Marines within the last decade. He's been shot twice and blasted by an IED. The IED was a ticket home, where he got a job managing three Hardee's in the area. The "interview" for the job was a West Virginia football game, where he got hammered and had flashbacks from the fireworks. "I freaked out," he said. After a pause, "And I got the job the next day." For a while, he took post-tramautic stress disorder ("PSTD", he called it), but it killed his personality. "I'll take the flashbacks," he said. He also said he'd die before his son grew up as poor as he did, eating PB&J for dinner. That made me happy to hear.
He dropped us at the Sapphire Inn where we got a 10% discount for being A.T. thru-hikers. We had fajitas at a Mexican place across the street and lounged in the room until around midnight. I took off my boots for a shower before dinner and found a browned and swelled pinky toe. It burned under water. Frostbite! I laughed and decided not to tell my parents when I called. I journaled later that night. Kevin watched TV. I wished I had the room to myself.

# Friday, February 19, 2010 — Siler Bald Shelter
**Start Location:** Sapphire Inn (Franklin, NC)
**Miles Today:** 6
**Trip Miles:** 127.80

We left late the next morning. I drank 4-5 cups of coffee and updated my blog on the hotel’s computer. Kevin packed up and watched TV in the room. At 11:00 we walked over to Hardee’s. Kevin ordered 4 burgers and I brought in some tortillas, PB and honey. We got a hitch to the tail from another young local. “S***, man. Just came from a funeral. I had to get the F*** outa there.” A buddy of 21 years had gotten drunk and dropped a cigarette in the couch. The house caught fire and “they found him right next to the F*** door”, he said. “I guess the smoke just got to him”. He got quiet. “We all knew him pretty well.” He pulled over and ran into a convenience store. He came out with a brown bag and drove off. He steered with his knees and rolled a cigarette. “I’d offer you some weed but my girlfriend has it all.” He complained about unemployment and not being able to provide for his kids. He seemed so worn out by it all. He dropped us at the trailhead and drove off.
The hike in was only 6 miles, a steady climb on a good trail. At the shelter we ate two burgers that Kevin had mistakenly received at the Hardee's, and we went to bed early after a game of cards. Playing cards in the cold takes a lot of effort.

# Saturday, February 20, 2010 — Cold Spring Shelter
**Start Location:** Siler Bald Shelter
**Miles Today:** 12.60
**Trip Miles:** 140.40

We started late the next day, the day that would be the physically hardest yet of my journey. After a morning of lounging in the sun and eating, I was on the trail at noon. My destination: Cold Spring shelter, 12 miles away. The snow was deep over Siler’s Bald, where the imaginary Joseph Siler grazed stock nearly 200 years ago, and I followed Kevin’s prints. I caught up with him at Wayah Gap after 2 miles of trudging. I was enjoying myself, yelling “Wayah” over and over again in a high pitched voice.
The ascent after Wayah was difficult. I blazed through knee-deep snow for nearly 2 miles, stopping every 20 steps to catch my breath. That wore me out. The trail wound around the mountain and up to an old stone observation tower built by the CCC in 1933. We stopped to take photos and eat dinner (it was 5:00). We hit the trail again in an hour under a setting sun.. The snow looked orange. We didn’t want to go but knew we had to in order to make it to NOC in time to meet Kevin’s friend, so that night we hiked until 10:00 pm to Cold Spring Shelter, totaling 12 miles that day.

---

# Sunday, February 21, 2010 — A cabin (NOC)
**Start Location:** Cold Spring Shelter
**Miles Today:** 12
**Trip Miles:** 152.40

There were 12 miles to go before the NOC, so we got up early (7:45) and hit the trail. The conditions on the hike were good – better than the day before – and we made excellent time. 12 miles in 5 hours, thanks in part to a 6 mile downhill. The last bit of the trail was paradise. The sun hit down in to the pines and to the understory, and the world was green and brown. I savored the smell of the pines. “This is how the South should smell,” I thought. That snowless section, though short, redeemed all days before it. Or at least gave them a happy ending.
Kevin’s friend treated us well that night, feeding us homebaked cookies, cheetos, and whiskey and then taking us out for $15 steaks. The house was warm and, honestly, that was the biggest treat of all. They’re good friends and got drunk. I sat inside and wrote. It felt like a perfect day off, as do any long days with a warm-bed ending.
At this point on the trail, I don’t know how I feel. Since joining up with Kevin, I feel like the emotional growth has stopped. It’s just been a social experience since and doesn’t excite me like the first leg of the journey did. I’m kind of bored with it, in fact, because it’s no longer mine. It’s shared with Kevin. My happy memories all lie in the first week, before Kevin. Since, it’s been dull and lifeless. God hasn’t been there. He hasn’t said a thing. It makes me hate Kevin for robbing it all from me, this once-in-a-lifetime season with God. I need to get away. I’ve decided that. I don’t know how. Will god put an opportunity in my lap to sneak away? Or should I just break away. For now, everyday is a lost one with Kevin. Every day is just like the rest. 
I wrote all that just several hours before, as a timely answer to my prayers, Kevin decided to take a “zero day” and let me hike on. We’d catch up in Fontana, three days away. It was just so perfect the way it worked out, you know? Maybe a wink from Him, saying “don’t you worry. Just seek me and you’ll find me.”

# Monday, February 22, 2010 — Sassafras Gap Shelter
**Start Location:** A cabin (NOC)
**Miles Today:** 7.50
**Trip Miles:** 159.90

So we ate a huge brunch and at 12:30 Kevin and his friend drove me to the trailhead. I was so happy to be off again, alone on my quest. The sun was out, snow melted and there was smell of pine everywhere. Just like summer! I took my shirt off and yipped aloud.
I thought about my family and how much I miss them. They’ve done so much for me already, loved me so fully that I teared-up thinking about it. I saw god in all the beauty there. Our family is such a sold rock.
By and by the trial became snowy and deep, and splintered rhododendron thickets, limbs and full trees blocked the trail every 50-some feet. Anger came at all the slipping and sliding. My frostbite blisters ached. So did my heel blisters. The deep snow and debris persisted. My anger grew. By the time I reached the shelter, that anger had burned me out. I didn’t really feel anything, and so the day ended on kind of a sour note. That night the wind made strange noises that kept me on edge. The drips of the shelter sounded just like feet crunching through show, and several times I got out of my sleeping bag and sent out to see nothing.

# Tuesday, February 23, 2010 — Brown Fork Gap Shelter
**Start Location:** Sassafras Gap Shelter
**Miles Today:** 9.10
**Trip Miles:** 169

I awoke late that morning. Being alone is good, but it’s just so lonely. Kevin is irritating me but I think it all may be more pleasant with him around. Not better for me, just more pleasant.
At noon I left. A very late start to my destination 10 miles away. I’d eaten all of my cliff bars, smoked pipe, and played my harmonica. All was well. I was cursing again up the mountain to Cheoah Bald, furious at the debris blocking the trail and snow slipping under my feet. I hated everything around me, I hated god, and I hated myself. Fog was everywhere.
The trail disappeared at Cheoah and it took a while to find. My anger was still around just quieted down. Another hour passed and the fog lifted. Suddenly, the sun broke through and illuminated the trail.. Bugs began to fly. Birds called. My heart was lifted and cleared out, and I laughed outloud. I thought about my family and how much love is there and started to cry in joy. I’m so emotionally unstable. Maybe I’m just mimicking a trail that itself is so irregular. Then I thought deeply about anger. Because I felt like people walking in the woods should think deeply about things. Anger comes up from below, I figured, only when a happy ending is no where in sight. It’s when you feel like your stranded in a bad situation with no ladder around to climb out. When I know the shelter is right around the corner, I don’t care how many limbs are on the trail. The end is near. But for some reason it angers me when I don’t know how long the struggle will ensue. Trudging through snow is okay if I know the shelter is near, but I go to rage when the end is nowhere in sight.
In the sunshine I thought also about my friends at JMU. Leaving them behind and hiking with a stranger, I realize how deep and true they all are. I’m not talking about my dear old friends, Sean and Wesley, whose role in my life day to day is marginal nowadays. I’m talking about the Treehouse boys (my roommates), who I see now are so much more than I realized. Something about them – maybe their humor, maybe their devotion to each other, maybe the way they gave themselves so truly to me – strikes a chord deep in my heart. I didn’t see it before, but looking back alone in the woods I see it now: Rawlz, Chocolate, Seth, Barefoot, Cameron, Will and Fedesh were a gift. They were God showing me how it should be. I almost cried thinking about the gift.
As you can see, reader, I’m entirely emotionally unstable as I hike towards Maine. I fly high in the morning, curse God at noon, whimper in the evening, and quietly surrender myself to His will before I go to bed. It’s an incredible high relief experience, now that I think about it, that few are fortunate enough to have. The portrait of god out here, captured through the lens of my twisted hart, is so shocking. So outrageous. So explosive. I’m seeing colors flashing and booming in my heart that I never knew existed.
That night I slept at the Brown fork Shelter with Bill, a skinny old guy with a beard. He was good company. He liked to talk wild about anything that was worth talking about with a loud and enthusiastic voice. Trail conditions, hiking at night, his dog, good gear, philosophical matters. Like I said, he’s good energy generating company.

# Wednesday, February 24, 2010 — Fontana Lodge (Fontana Village)
**Start Location:** Brown Fork Gap Shelter
**Miles Today:** 12
**Trip Miles:** 181

We all got up in the morning to make it 12 miles to Fontana Dam. I really didn’t feel like hiking and I cursed on the way out. My mom says I’m angry and need to deal with it. She says that maybe I have anger buried deep and that this walk will help release it. All I know is that I have a lot of anger and it boils out on the trail. The demons spill out, yeah, but I still don’t know how to extinguish them before they manifest in all my rage. I haven’t accomplished anything until I’ve accomplished that.
By 2:00 I was thumbing for a ride into Fontana Village – a older guy in a pick-up stopped. He was on his way to work on some village lodges and said in a North Carolina accent that he’d love to say “F* society” and go into the woods. I think every man has it somewhere in him, that drive away from the world and into the woods.
At the post office I picked up my new showshoes and strapped them to my back. The other package –my food maildrop- hadn’t yet arrived so I walked over to the lodge to call home. On the way, I stopped by the convenience store and the clerk gave me a free sausage dog. I loaded it up with relish, cheese, and chili and bought a chocolate milk and candy bar to wash it down. At the lodge I dialed home and , as it turned out, they had my package right behind the counter. “You’re Ford?”, she said. “Ford Prior?” I was warm and cozy in the lobby and so got a room for $60 – I’d get $30 off for a broken heater. I washed up back at the room. I read the letters in the care package and thought about home before falling sleep. The chef called to invite me to dinner and I feel asleep again.

In the morning I went to the front desk at 6:45 and asked for some money back. The heater had kept me awake and restless during my one night of what should have been sweet dreams. I got half of my money back and typed on the guest computer for an hour or two. I went back to sleep, got up and returned to the lobby. Kevin and Bill soon showed up. We lounged there for several hours then hitched to the Fontana Dam Shelter just up the road. Bill, Kevin and I went into town to resupply. At the shelter we ate almost uncontrollably into our food stash and had to force ourselves to stop.

**Start Location:** Fontana Dam Shelter

**Trip Miles:** 193.30

Since before leaving home, I’d gloomily anticipated entering the Great Smoky Mountains. It lay like a snowy wall before us, visible now and again from on ly the highest peaks but always on the back of our minds. Today we entered it, crossing over Fontana Dam and into the woods. Huge snowflakes fell. The grade was steep, as we recovered elevation, and with higher altitudes came old snow. That day 12 miles weren’t difficult, well, they were like any miles, reader; they had their curses and laughs and felt linger than they actually were. Mollies Ridge shelter was nice, and we built a fire that wouldn’t stay lit. It snowed all night.

# Saturday, February 27, 2010 — Derrick Knob Shelter
**Start Location:** Mollie's Ridge Shelter

**Trip Miles:** 205.30

That night was very cold. Bill, the 51 year old 4-time Ironman athlete, said “back home, nobody is ever going to understand. They’ll ask, “was it cold?” All you’ll be able to say is “yes, it was cold.” He also spoke of toughness. “You’re going to forget a lot of this, like how tough you had to be. You’re going to have to remind yourself, time and again for the rest of your life, how tough you really are.” I thought about that.
The previous morning we woke and set off to Derrick Knob , another 12 miles up and over Thunderhead Mountain. I blazed and it broke me, and that day I cried like a baby. I screamed, too. And cursed. It was just so hard I didn’t know what to do. If there had of been someone with me, I would’ve tempered myself. But there were no pressures to keep my cool and I exploded. Friends and family may wonder, “happy ole Ford has anger problems?” I say not really, but you’d be a different man or woman, too, if you were in my position. You’d lose yourself like you never thought you would.

What a day! It’s funny how you can wake up in the morning and all sorts of things happen and that night you wind up falling asleep in some bizarre place you’d never of guessed. It’s wild. That night I fell asleep spooning with Kevin and cramped up against two large propane tanks. Tight around us was a high wall fence for the tanks, which plugged into the back of a locked weather building next to Route 441 at Newfound Gap. We had hiked 18 miles in the worst of conditions. We hoped to hitch into town at Route 441, but it was desolate, closed, we guessed. The march from Derrick Knob took us to the top of Clingman’s Dome, the AT’s highest point, and down to the gap in 15 hours. Hiking for 15 hours (that includes your four 15 minute breaks) in 2 feet of snow (sometimes 3 foot drifts) will take the fight out of you, until 1:00am we walked, slowly aching and soring all in places we never thought we’d ache and sore. Like my collarbone, which I broke in 9th grade. It was hard, and I pushed my mind and body just a little farther towards wherever we should be pushing our mind and body. 
*Looking back, I realize how intense that night was.

**Start Location:** On the side of the road (U.S. 442)

Redemption Days, I call them, are when you go into town, you take a hot shower like you’ve never had one before. You eat a meal and close your eyes and wish it would never end. And you sleep in a warm bed in dry clothes and you feel just like a little kid again. 
Today, we awoke to the sound of snowplow trucks in reverse. I climbed out of the propane area and ran out to the road in my long underwear. I flagged down the truck. The driver looked at me funny. I didn’t know what to say. “Can you help us out?” He said he couldn’t give us a ride to town but a park ranger would be up in about an hour. He showed up in an hour in his big white suburban and was glad to give us a lift. He talked in the car about how very few thru-hikers are dope-smoking hippies like he once believed. They’re a strong, healthy bunch, he said.
He dropped us at the Visitors Center and I flipped through some summer photography books from the Smokies. The warm, colorful photos made me laugh and tear up. The coming of Spring and Summer arouses such strong emotions for a nomad in the cold.
Kevin’s friend, a grad student working on his thesis, picked us up and took us back to his uncle’s mountain house. We got pizza and beer and lounged by the television. I took a nap and a hot shower and then another nap. Sleep came early that night on a full belly and central heat.

Some say getting back on the trail after a day off is difficult, but hitting the trail after our day off at Gatlinburg wasn’t too bad. Our pockets were stuffed with fruit and sausage biscuits as we walked three miles to Icewater Shelter The view was great over Cherokee and the sun was strong, so we stopped, gathered firewood, and relaxed for the afternoon. We slept sweet that night.

The next day was an 8 mile hump to Deck shelter in terrible conditions. It snowed all day and the sun buried in gray clouds. The trail disappeared and we had to blaze through 2 and 3 foot drifts that were often sloped so steeply as to collapse into mini-avalanches that would overcome a mouse. Kevin slid down the mountain some 30 feet, and I had to throw him a linie to drag his pck out. It was 45 minute ordeal. That night we arrived at almost 10pm. It was another long day in the Smokies. That night I punctured my blow-up thermarest, spilled my dinner all over the ground and broke Kevin’s spoon. I was angry.

The next day we covered 14 miles to the Crosby Knob shelter, a 10 hour hike. Another difficult day. I could get used to this cold, wet snow hiking, but it would be a miserable existence. Like a caveman. Today we blazed trail again, showshoeing through virgin drifts. At Crosby Knob, I found a cigar and smoked it after dinner and drank hot chocolate. Not a bad night. Actually, quite a pleasant one. I’ll never forget the simple pleasure of hot chocolate on a cold night and the glow of the cigar in the pitch black.

# Friday, March 05, 2010 — Standing Bear Farm Hostel
**Start Location:** Cosby Knob Shelter
**Miles Today:** 10
**Trip Miles:** 255.30

Getting out of that sleeping bag in the cold is the hardest part of the day. Every morning I lie in my “womb” for as long as I can, trying to convince myself that I’ll make it to my next destination on time, even if I lie just a little longer. That morning was one of those mornings. The sun was high and schedule tight by the time I was out of the bag and on my feet.
The day’s destination was the Standing Bear Farm Hostel, several miles out of the Smokies. The last push wasn’t bad, moving slowly but with momentum, up and over the last mountain. I blazed with snowshoes and Kevin followed. We ran into four Spring Break hikers from Roanoke College – Casey-Lynn, Erin, Cary and Alex Ali (from Godwin!) – coming in the opposite direction. I burst out in excitement, “Oye!” and asiled them with questions and marvels of the trail. A friendly bunch they were, and matched my enthusiasm. They were astounded to run into a veritable thru-hiker, as I’ve been so many times before, and I felt for a moment that my undertaking was indeed greater than myself, that in the eyes of the world, this was a real-life epic, and it was all steered by little ol’ me. And I won’t feign humility here; it sure does feel like it sometimes. They gave us carrots, Kashi bars, and one delicious apple (thanks guys! You’re Angels!) to quiet our grumbling stomachs and hugs to sate a month dry of human contact.
The snow cleared up and we stripped off our snowshoes. Down the hill we ran, yipping and hollering. At last, our feet were free from snow and shoe for the first time in three burdened days-and the liberty was exhilarating. The sun broke through the clouds and illuminated the snow. The sky was blue. I laughed to myself and almost cried: How can it be that the sky opens so easily? How can things be okay again so quickly? One thing I’ve learned in the past month is to expect that of life. When it goes way down it’s okay because it’ll surface again. It gets so bad out here-the snow, the ice, wind, the debris- but I’ve slowly come to know that it’s okay. “Just hang on,” I tell myself. “It’ll be better soon.” When I get home I’ll remember that, because some years ago my mother looked at me hard and said “things are great now, but they won’t be forever”. So when things do go bad I’ll remember the Smokies and all that snow. It’s gets better at the bottom of the hill.
I lay in the sun and took a nap. Lou, from Kentucky, woke me up. He was passing on to the next shelter to “get away and read a little bit.” He had turned back from the trailhead near Gatlinburg, through which I was proud to say we’d fought, successfully. We shook hands and moved on. I arrived at Standing Bear in the afternoon and met Curtis, the owner. Curtis is rough-looking hippie with tough hands and a ponytail. “F* off, we’re full!” he said with a cigarette in his mouth when I rounded the corner. I laughed and sat on the porch. That night we sat by the wood stove, ate Mom’s banana bread and drank a 24 oz. Heiniken. No hot showers. Oh well.

When you really don't want to hit the trail, it seems time slips by quicker. This morning we woke late (at least for us) and lay silent in our sleeping bags until nearly 9:30. It had been a late night in the hostel bunkhouse as Kevin, myself, and Hawk the caretaker built homemade alcohol stoves until past 1am to the sound of hard rock radio and in the heat of the bunkhouse's wood stove. With Hawk's recycled metal, I built two new experimental stoves. In case you didn't know, reader, alcohol stoves are made with beer cans and cheap scrap metals. Using the alcohol in your medicine cabinet as fuel, you can boil a pot of water in five minutes. A cool, lightweight and easy-to-make outdoor gear. I bought a 24 oz. Heineken can, drank the contents and built a replacement piece for my old stove. By the time I hit the sack, I was exhausted.
I ate like a lion today, almost uncontrollably. The trail mix, granola, and whole grain couscous was all so good. I was just so hungry. It made me feel full, sleepy and comfortable like I hadn't felt since relaxing at home a month ago.
Curtis, the owner, gave us a tour of the old tobacco farm. I saw a foot-thick American Chestnut tree, which excited me. Curtis was a nice guy, a burned-out yet shrewd hippie with a ponytail and more than an ounce of simmering ambition. He ranted about his farm's potential in a niche organic tobacco market; "Right now, all I farm is hikers. And rocks. That's a figue speech, you know." Whenever he made a joke he paused to clarify with that same phrase: "It's a figure of speech," even when it wasn't a figure of speech. He showed me a sheet of fresna lense, which, used like a magnifying glass on ants, could "melt a penny in a minute". Indeed, in a couple seconds it burned my hand. Curtis laughed.
I sent off some journal entries and at 3:45 we were on the road again towards Maine. The hike wore me out. I was blazing again. We caught a magnificent sunset ontop of the Snowbird Mountain bald. Layered in red and velvet, the Smokies stood solemnly like a blue and white fortress wall. It was the most beautiful I've ever seen. I was pissed about the tough climb. Had Kevin not been there to hold me up and remind me of the beauty, I'd of moped right on down the mountain, counting my curses. I didn't really think about God then, as some of you readers would have hoped. I just thought about how everything fits nicely in the end, and how this sunset was some kind of redemption from the painful two weeks in the Smokies we'd just left behind. 
The last stretch of the hike was mild. Kevin led with his headlamp, which I call the "Eye of God" for its brightness. We chatted to pass the time. That night Kevin extinguished an all-too-audacious mouse with the sharp end of his trekking pole and we ate chocolate bars.

"Dude, I just don't care anymore," I told Kevin several hours into the next day. He sort of laughed. "Neither do I, man. I've thought more about quitting today than I ever did in the Smokies." It was true. We'd covered over 250 miles and broke past our most formidable challenge, the Great Smoky Mountains, a climax in itself. But the trail felt empty post-climactic void. There was nothing really to look forward to now. No dramatic punctuations. Just dull and difficult miles, and 2,000 miles of them.
That morning had been another late start. We just couldn't move on with any intention or speed. I was angry at Kevin for something stupid and left before him. On the mountain my toes went numb and dangerously close to frostbite. I groaned and groaned at the pain. I finally pulled over, took off my shoes and socks, and heated up my feet over the stove until my feet stopped hurting. The feeling was vaguely there, but the frostbite pain (which is like someone bending your toes backwards) was gone. Kevin walked up and sat down. We cooked a hot meal in the middle of the trail and moved along. (I learned later that I'd sustained more frostbite on my big toe, but the skin was protected by thick toe-pad callus. Writing 2 days later, it's still totally numb on both toes).
At Max Patch, an amazing bald so large that airplanes used to land on it, we found some dayhikers and talked to them as the sun set. Then it was on to Roaring Fork Shelter, where we found two more overnighters to share the lean-to. “People! Kevin, people! Are you excited? I’m excited.” He was. This was the first night with company. After almost a month of occupying shelters with just Kevin, seeing a light through the woods beyond the “SHELTER” sign brought me to a yip and a yell. In fact, all the human contact that day filled me up; the shelter company was just icing on the cake.
Yeah, we were weary coming out of the Smokies, but we’d moved on that day hoping for a little inspiration. Mr. Boyer said I’d empty out for a long time before the Lord would fill me back up. So maybe that’s what’s happening now. I do not fear it. It’s no fun, but I do not fear it.

**Trip Miles:** 293

Many nights, I open my eyes in confusion. I awake from deep dreams of home, so it sickens the stomach when one realizes he's far from it. Sadly, that hard floor below and black shelter ceiling above mean one thing: I'm on the A.T. The disappoinment is alawys deep. Early this morning I awoke in Hot Springs, lying under soft bed covers in a heated cabin, and it hit me. Opening my eyes was deeply disappointing. The dream wasn't of home (actually, it was of NASCAR races in the Outer Banks, NC), but it was so warm and fuzzy. It wasn't along the A.T. where, deep down, I don't want to be. That's right: I don't want to be here 
That "Live in the present" B.S. only works for 10-second bursts available 3 to 5 times a day. The rest of the day sucks, and one can either spend time not thinking (i.e. approaching mental fluidity and Zen) or thinking (i.e. consciously cursing each bump on the trail). I move back and forth between both.
So even though I was riding the gravy train in Hot Springs, I still didn't want to be there. I wanted to be home. As for the day's schedule, there's not much to say. Eating heartily between each event, we relaxed, showered, hot tubbed, and slept. The best part of the day? Plunging into the icy Frech Broad River from the cozy hot springs. 
So to all you faithful readers who say to yourselves, "DOESN'T WANT TO BE THERE?! IS HE CRAZY? HE'S LIVING THE DREAM!", remember that, no matter how uncomfortable I am, I'm following Truth and that's all I need. "Following truth" sounds cheesy and over-inflated, but honestly that's the only reason I'm here. That is what's binding me to The Trail.
P.S. Sorry about the sporadic entries. My faithful mother is serving as secretary and transcribing the journal pages I'm mailing from trail towns. Using a computer like I am now is an exception.

March 11
 
The vortex. That’s what the lady at the outfitter called it. I’m not familiar with the vortex but I’ve felt its presence especially as Kevin and I debated on whether or not to move on today. When your feet stop moving the pull of the vortex begins, they say. First it’s an extra day of rest, then it’s a week, then you’ve given up. But it wasn’t like that for us. We just needed another day of rest, and, writing a day later, I’m glad we kicked up our feet another day. No regrets. I’m all alone now, sitting in a diner at 6:45am. It’s warm outside and rain is coming. I’m as happy as I could be to be one country breakfast away from hitting the trail again.
 
A man behind with suspenders and a white beard rambled on to every local who comes in the door. “Johnny, d’you remember when the bank got robbed?” he says to Johnny, who pays for a to-go cup of coffee. The old bearded man tells the story just as he did to the last passerby. Johnny tries to go. “Darn it, Johnny, sit down here and let’s talk,” gripes the old man. After 20-some minutes the conversation goes to corporal punishment, “You know that’s what’s a matter with kids these days. Hell, I’ll come over there and whip ‘em myself!” Then stories are exchanged.
The day's hike was not a bad one, but climbing back into the mountains from Hot Springs made me question why I was moving on in the first place. The old-timer's rambling 9-5 routine was so appealing. Rain broke, and I reached the shelter feeling miserable and cursing under my breath. But, as always, I got in my sleeping bag and everything was alright.

Today ended with seven hikers, lined like sardines in a shelter with the rain pattering on the roof. I wished I was alone, but oh well. The day had been a good one – almost 16 miles – and clear enough to keep me in bright spirits. It rained on and off and I was always wet, but the air was balmy and wind low and I stayed lkay the whole day. I won’t go into the boring details because to everyone except me they’re just that: boring.
 
So at the shelter we met some kids from Appalachian State, including two pretty girls. It was nice being around some pretty girls. They gave us a full loaf of home-risen bread. In the morning, I hiked alone in the sunshine and had a revelation about the “remember how tough you are” bit of advice. Nobody’s ever a coward or a wimp, they just don’t remember how tough they are. And when you’re a Christian, it’s not remembering how tough He is.
 
I got up in the dark of the night. The rain was really coming down in heaves and everyone was asleep. Someone snored nightly. I looked out in the gloomy woods, just a mess of dark gray and black. It was all so beautiful, and I wondered if this was God romancing me, you know? I lit a pipe and watched the embers glow and die and glow and die, not knowing what the silence of the night meant, but knowing it meant something.

Another beautiful day, and hopes were high as I crossed mile 300. I was leading the pack, the second northbound thru-hiker of the worse-weathered season in recent memory, and I felt strong and confident. Three hundred miles of ups and downs and here I am: on the bright side. We made it to our shelter before nightfall, and found 2 beers, 7 sodas floating in the icy cold pool by the spring. Our first encounter with premeditated trail magic! I used ear plugs that night for Rooster’s snoring. I’m starting to write strange things in the trail registers. Yesterday, I wrote that monkeys stole all our food. Tonight I wrote that watch-selling gypsies showed up at 3am.

And I thought we were in the clear. The morning opened with an inch of still-falling snow on the ground, and we were off with moderate spirits, and I was feeling alright, in the zone. But approaching the top of Big Bald, the trail simply disappeared. The snow was knee-deep by now. Two experienced college kids had given up searching the day before and set up an emergency shelter. A 20-something couple had done the same. Both groups headed back down the mountain, but we didn't have the luxury of turning back. We took a photo of a contour map and kept trudging on. The trail – or lack there of – was hell, and we wandered the woods, completely lost. Finally, we found some cross country ski tracks and followed them to the shelter. I don’t feel like recounting those last 10 miles, but I got lost a couple more times for 30 minutes, broke my trekking pole against a tree in anger, and arrived to camp in the pitch black of night. Deep snow, bad downfalls, a numb-toed nap in a hollowed-out tree. Twenty-one miles and a long, long day. But we made it, and all’s well that ends well.

All-You-Can-Eat pizza took the place of breakfast, lunch, and dinner today. We sat in Erwin’s Pizza Plus for several hours, eating pizza after pizza and drinking Mountain Dew. It was incredible. It made my day. We’d trotted 6 miles into town that morning to resupply and left to the next shelter late that afternoon. I bought fuel, 7 snickers bars, 7 oatmenal packets, lemondade mix, 2 ramens, and mixed two varieties of trail mix – nuts, raisins and baking chocolates & pinapple, mangoes, cranberries and nuts. Enough for 3 days of strenuous hiking. We also did a load of detergentless laundry at the coin laundry. Rooster, the kindhearted Arizonan we’d picked up in the Springs, decided to quit. “It wasn’t what I thought it’d be, man. Not like last year.” I’ll miss him and the way he calmed the room. Oh well. We got to the shelter that night in the dark. I smoked my pipe, drank hot tea, and whished I was alone. The other guys just wouldn’t stop talking loudly. An interesting thought: Toe Man said that when he’s hiking alone he knows exactly where he is , but when he’s with company he doesn’t really know what’s going on. He relies on others to lead him. Life is like that , he said. I agree. Things are so clear alone.

Robin said that (even though we are out of the Smokies) challenges lay ahead. Yesterday I army-crawled over Unaka Mountain, and I realized how right she was. Unaka was buried with 3 feet of snow, and on the way up we ran into a Citadel grad, 3 months shy of deployment to Iraq. He said he’d been on the mountain for three days, trying unsuccessfully to push through the snow and downfall with his GPS. He’d lost the trail. "Want us to lead you over?," Toe Man asked. "We're not turning back." In a couple hours, we broke through the mess. “What does that say about the U.S. Military?” Toe Man joked.   Every soul we’ve encountered has been in escape of the mountain, retreating with head hung low. That days hike carried over into night. Even with my headlamp, all was murky as thick fog rolled in. I was ahead, and when I got to the shelter I sat out in the dark to smoke my pipe. No headlamp; just my pipe, the dark and I.

You never really know who to trust when asking about the trail ahead. Everyone has his or her standards of assessment, so when Joe at the trailhead looks wearily at me and says, “Turn back man. It’s impossible.” The trail may in fact be quite the opposite. It may be an easy day. So whenever someone tells me it’s impossible, I size ‘em up. What are they wearing? Do they sound frantic? How long were they at it? And did they use the work “impossible”? Because if they did, they are not to be trusted. Down in Erwin, the outfitter told us (in crude language) that Roan Mountain would be extremely difficult, that we should wait for better weather. Well, we made it over Roan today defying the outfitter’s forecast of failure and surprising the critics once again. It was hard, but not as hard as he said. Off the mountain I was soaked with snow, sweat, and ice-melt. I met aaron, a warmhearted man on his way down from a day-hike. He was full of love. Or maybe it was joy. Aaron: if you read this, thanks for brightening my life. You radiate, man. I caught a “God Bless” when we parted ways and I think it may have something to do with it.
 
Next we climbed several balds, open grassy expanses that took me back to scenes from Braveheart. Lone Scots running along highland ridges with bagpipes in the background. The bagpipes played on as we walked with 360 degree panoramic views.
 
Off the balds we lost the trail. We ended up following a old logging road to the bottom of the vally. In the dark, we spotted a dimly lit mansion and approached. Upon knocking we met Jim Morton, who gave us directions back to the trail but offered us a night in one of his five cabins on the property. We couldn’t believe our good fortune, and I fell asleep that night on a soft bed. Trail magic, once again.

I was all out of food, so the next day’s journey was a hungry one. We crossed two 5,500 foot balks and descended down to Elk Park, TN over the course of 9 miles. I got ahead of Toe Man and Kevin and, at the road, hitchhiked in to town to pick up my maildrop. I was ecstatic to be away from the fellas. They were really starting to get on my nerves, and I felt the rush of freedom as I sat at the hostel and slit open the maildrop box with my knife. Or maybe that was just the rush of seeing a zip-lock bag of homemade cookies! I took a shower, stoked the wood stove, ate cookies, and walked around the living room if the hostel, not really sure what to do with myself. Free time? For all the vagrant conceptions of thru-hikers, we’re actually a busy bunch. Free time is a treat.

I passed a “mile 400” sign today in a ravine, and I kept on walking, wondering how I made it this far. I thought back to the second day, when I felt like things couldn’t get any worse, and I wonder what bizarre force pushed me on. Was it will? Stubborness? Faith? Or something other than that?
 
Tonight is the most quiet night of the walk so far. It’s like a glassy lake fogged with darkness. I’m alone tonight again and glad for it. “Make it stop”. I kept saying aloud on the way here. It wad dark and my feet were at their limit, pounding with a pain I just couldn’t numb my mind to. My feet were not happy, and every step was a reminder of 400 miles of walking, these were the most painful of all. I did something I’ve never done before, right then: I asked God for strength. I didn’t really know what else to do. I wasn’t angry or emotional like before – I shed neither rage nor tears – but just tired of my feet hurting. And my prayer worked like a good medicine. In a couple of minutes, a second wind picked me up and carried me to the shelter.
 
Like I said, that night was quiet like a cathedral. You could feel it all around you, that still and open space that afforded the lonely hiker with a sense of safety in the night.

I think if Jesus was around, he’d sit down and talk wit you about your favorite thing, no matter how boring it was. He’d pretend to be interested while the NASCAR fan talked his ear off about why Dale Jarret should be in the Hall of Fame. He’d ask questions, too, and pretend to be excited with you. “Wait, he won the Daytona how many times?!?!” There aren’t enough people like Jesus around to encourage us to spout off our passions, so we begin to believe that those passions aren’t worth being passionate about. I try to jump in like Jesus would, but I forget most days. I mean, it’s exhausting.
 
Today I went to church with Bob Peoples, owner of the Kincora Hostel, and after the service he invited me to a dinner. It was all old folks, but I sat with a girl my age who wants to open a quilt shop. She was a really nice girl. After the dinner, I sat around and chatted while Bob helped clean up with the other men. “They wanna do their part so I understand,” said the woman who prepared the dinner, “but it’d be quicker if they just let me do it. They don’t know where anything goes.” Her husband came out to catch his breath ,and started talking to me about his German Shepard. Nobody was really listening to him as he went on, so I stepped up and played Jesus. “It’s only two years and weighs 105 lbs.!?!? Does she eat a lot?” And doing that for him, really validating his passion, filled me up. 
 
The woman was overweight and had short-hair and was the kind I would have passed on the street with a judgemental eye. But she sprang to life as I talked to her about her work with the church and state as a counselor psychologist. She was full of love, like we all should be. She mentioned her five kids. “It sounds like you’re a mother to more than five,” I said.
 
Back at the hostel I talked with five students from Grinnell College, and it hit me how sociable JMU kids are by comparison. JMU kids know the art of communication and pride themselves in being exceptionally agreeable citizens. Kids from smaller, private liberal arts schools tend to communicate awkwardly and choose not to shake hands and smile. So it seems, at least.

The whole situation doesn’t irritate me too much, but I am disappointed to be wasting away this beautiful weather. I wish I just felt good. I could really start complaining here but I’ll save my time. Can’t wait to be back on the trail tomorrow but fearing my feet.

Yesterday was another day split by dull pain and bright moments of joy. I ate some cold oatmeal (it's better cold, I beleive) and left Double Spring Shelter at 9:36. According to Tony, it was "surely" no more than 8 miles to Damascus, a section he claimed was "the easiest section on the Trail." Not true. I cursed him under my breath the whole way for being so sure about something he obviously knew nothing about. Before long I was at the gap and soon after that Abingdon Shelter. There, I cooked (and ate) too much couscous and fell asleep with my feet propped up to reduce swelling. I woke nearly an hour later from deep sleep. My head felt fresh but my feet hurt badly. The march down to Damascus was a difficult one, but I was there by 5:00. At The Place, an unattended $5-donation hostel run by the Methodist Church, I ate too many candy bars (a bag of them, left as Trail Magic in the hostel). I left to grab a bacon cheesburger, Mountain Dew, and an ice cream bar. Then, an old-timer invited me back to his house for teriyaki chicken. I obliged. His name was Larry, and he's got a wild story. He escaped the law and hid in the woods for 3 years, until he had a spiritual revelation and turned himself in. He did time and came out somewhat reformed. Since, Damascus has taken him in and he's taken to helping hikers. Now, Larry lives with his dog and cat. He stands in front of a warehouse and sells yard-sale things. That night, I ate more candy bars and fell asleep.

My zero day in Damascus has little to say. I was supposed to walk over to Larry's to buy some eggs and turn his garden, but instead I ate dougnuts and walked over to Mount Rogers Outfitters to try on some insoles. My feet were killing me. Jeff, the large, kindhearted foot expert there, fitted me for some Superfeet insoles and said it would solve my problems. It took him a half hour to explain the foot-mechanics behind my pain, and I appreciated every minute of it. It's not often you run across someone who really knows what they're talking about. I met up with Lucky, a SOBO, and another section hiker. We power-walked a mile or so to a Pizza Plus (all-you-can-eat pizza), then waddled like penquins back to the hostel. I took a nap then walked over to Joe's Gym, and I paid him $5 for a MMA lesson. We practiced kickboxing kicks, boxing drills, ju-jitsu holds, and muy thai clinches. Afterwards I lifted weights. Shaking up the routine like that it sometimes all a hiker needs. Hanging out with Joe freshened my spirits. That night we went to Quincy's Bar & Grill and I had a Star Hill IPA and a grilled cheese. It was live music night, and we listened to some suprisingly-talented locals sing, strum the guitar, and play the harmonica. "In Color" was my favorite cover they performed. Everyone at the bar was singing along. The other hikers watched the March Madness game and I watched the locals interact. The Place was cold and had only dirty towels (yea, I may have used one or two) and hardwood beds, so it was just a step up from the shelter. Still, I slept alright.

Today my dad came! I woke up early and walked across the street to Augusta's Appalachian Inn. I'd met Terry and Sissy on their front porch of their B&B the day I entered town, so I recommended the place to my dad. down the street/AT for a diner for a breakfast of pancakes, bacon and egg. From there I hit the trail for an 18-mile day hike (I'd hitch back to Damascus that afternoon to meet my dad). I was anxious to get some more miles under my belt. 
A mile down the trail, I realized that I forgot the pay for my breakfast. But I disappeared into the woods and told myself I'd pay when I got back to town. It was raining and I was soaked shortly, which was uncomfortable. I wore only Terry's daypack, so I was able to trail run off and on. My feet hurt.
For you history buffs, the trail was a cool one. It ran along the Virginia Creeper Trail, an old railroad used to export valuable timber from the region. Thanks to the Creeper, named for the "creeping" slow speeds of the trains, acres of old-growth poplar and hemlock forests were leveled and Damascus experienced a economic boom. The lumber boom died, the rail went to public transportation, and by the 1980's the state stripped the ties and closed the line. In it's place, they layed out the Virginia Creeper Scenic Trail. It is open for pedestrian, equestrian, and bicycle traffic. Between the trail and the rail flowed the Laurel River, a fairly-wide river popular for trout angling. The whole day, I could hear the dull roar of the river rapids.
By 2:30 I was at U.S. Highway 58 (1.5 mi N of Lost Mountain Shelter), where I was to meet my Dad in the parking lot at 5:00 PM. Too cold to wait, I thumbed a ride. The pick-up took my several miles down the road, but I found myself again on the side of the road, sticking out my thumb in the rain-turned-snow. It was cold.
After over 2 hours of thumbing unsuccessfully (I hated Mankind at this point), I saw Terry coming down the road in his new 4-door pick-up. It had been a cold and shivering wait, and I was too exhausted to be excited about this stroke up good fortune (*you see, my Dad had called in bad traffic and asked for Terry to come pick me up). I got back to the B&B, drank hot coffee, and took a shower before my Dad arrived. I got out of the showever and stopped: was that my Dad's voice downstairs? It was, and something ticked and I suddenly felt so safe. Yea, Pops was downstairs, and it was good.

That night we went out for burgers at Quincy's and met "Full Moon," our waiter and three-time 1,000-miler that worked also at the bike shop next store. We asked about biking the Virginia Creeper Trail tomorrow, and he gave us the low-down. We asked about the Tavern, a fancy restaurant in Abingdon, and he gave us the low-down. The chef came out and talked to us about the menu; the the scznitzel, he said, the scznitzel.
We drank some beers and walked back to Augusta's and sorted out my food. All I can say is that reunited with my Dad was one of the most amazing things I've yet experienced on the Trail. We went to bed around midnight.

What a weekend with Ford. I guess you can call me a "Guest" writer for Ford (Uncle Frank). After a great day in Damascus conquering the grueling downhill Creeper trail on bikes, we headed over to Abingdon to see the town and get a steak dinner before Ford hits the trail again. Abingdon is a very cool town that is home to The Tavern where Ford and I got the VERY best steak that I have had in memory. I don’t know if it was the self imposed fast that Ford and I were on in preparation for our dinner or the company but we both agreed that steak dinners like that don’t come frequently enough. After we gorged ourselves we lay back in our chairs, starred at each other and reminisced of great steak dinners of our time. We agreed that we must do better about keep track of great steak dinners and that more were surly to come. I also reminded Ford that a great lobster, not yet in the boat awaited him in Maine. Ford is a big topic with Ford nowadays and I don’t mind doing my part to make sure he gets his share of gastronomical events while in Virginia.
I put him back on the trail today. Rested I hope. The rain began to fall as Ford got his gear together put it on his back and slipped into his poncho. I was amazed at how fast he got his gear together and reminisced at the time when he was a scout when it took hours to leave the car for an overnight and he was ready and on the trail in 5 minutes for a week. After a hug and some encouraging words before he disappeared into the wet leaves of the Rhododendrons of the Appalachian Trail.
As I made my way back to Richmond, I thought about how much I wished I could be on the trail with Ford and what an amazing journey he is on. To be with him this weekend gave me some insight into his journey. It’s complicated but very simple. It seems like by being on the trail alone most of time, when you get to a small town like Damascus or Abingdon, connecting with people becomes a big part of the experience. No one does this with more enthusiasm than Ford. I am so proud to say I am Ford’s Dad.

**Start Location:** U.S. 58

**Trip Miles:** 488.10

Hey Everybodies! I'm losing steam documenting every detail of every day, so I'm just going to do a High-and-Low format to cut down on the tedium and simplify things a bit. Here it goes...
Highs: My first high was meeting up and picking the brain of Eric, a 7-time PCT (and 2-time AT) ultra-light thru-hiker with a 6 lbs. pack. Eric is 39 and works at a brewery out West to save money for his next thru-hike, and I asked him question after question about how he accomplishes a thru-hike. What do you eat? How often do you drink? Do you take ibuprofen? Why the umbrella? 
My second high was hiking on Whitetop Mountain in 100 mph winds (100 according to Eric). Crossing the bald, that mighty wind blew OFF his poncho and knocked me down twice. I just screamed with excitement, "Wooooooooo-hoo-hoo-hoo!". It was a blast. Eric said he'd never seen winds that high. "And it cost zero dollars and zero cents!", I said. Eric liked to trail run and I struggled to keep up.
Lows: Saying "Bye Dad" sucked. He dropped me at the trailhead and we both went our separate ways and I told myself, "Just keep walking. It'll all be fine. Just keep walking." I tried to be jolly but I felt so alone.

# Monday, March 29, 2010 — Trimpi Shelter
**Start Location:** Wise Shelter
**Miles Today:** 20
**Trip Miles:** 508.10

Highs: Seeing a young owl flap curiously around me. His flap was loud and awkward, and needed practice. That was at dusk, after I'd spent almost an hour trail running down to Trimpi Shelter. When I got to the shelter, two old fellas awaited me with a hot fire, and I dried my socks and boots.
Lows: It rained alot that morning/afternoon, and for a couple hours I sat in the shelter not wanting to move on into the rain. Getting started sucked. Another low was wandering with numb barefeet around Trimpi Shelter looking for firewood.

# Tuesday, March 30, 2010 — north of Atkins
**Start Location:** Trimpi Shelter
**Miles Today:** 27
**Trip Miles:** 535.10

Highs: Eating at a shelter after a morning of hunger, napping in the sun, smelling the pines. Also, I met Joe, a 2-time record-breaker for speed-hiking the PCT. He was also ultra-light. Joe was stocky with tattooed arms (not your typical long-distance hiker build). I hiked with him until near Atkins and picked his brain. "You'll be a different person when you get back," he promised me. "Something will change." At such a young age, he said I'd probably end up hiking the PCT next year. "Twenty-one? It's good you're getting into this stuff [long-distance hiking] so early," he said. He was in his 40's.
Another high was leaving Joe to trail-run to Atkins, down the mountains and into the pastureland. At the bog, the grass was lush and green, and I saw purplish-green jar plants. At Atkins, I ate veggies and picked up a maildrop at the Barnyard Restaurant and set off at sunset for some night hiking. I hiked until nearly 10:30 under a full moon. At the top of the mountain, I pulled off and layed out my sleeping bag under the moon. I toothed open a bottle of Dead Guy Ale and drank it, staring dazed at the moon. Everything was gray silver or hidden in moon-shadow. A full moon is an amazing thing.
Lows: None! Maybe a little foot pain in the beginning, but nothing qualifying as a low.

# Wednesday, March 31, 2010 — Jenkins Shelter
**Start Location:** north of Atkins
**Miles Today:** 30
**Trip Miles:** 565.10

Highs: Joe caught up with me mid-day, and covering ground with him was probably my high of the day. I asked him questions and let him talk. Also, getting up at sunrise on the mountaintop was a gratifying experience. Lastly, a tough 4-mile climb with Joe culminated at Chestnut Nob, a beautiful 270-degree view of the surrounding mountains. You could really see the hand of geology from the ridge, the pushed the mountains together into wrinkles and smoothed them over.
Lows: Eating too much cous-cous at lunch always sucks. I was burping it up all the way up Chestnut Nob. Good energy, I guess. The last bit of night-hiking sucked. I was just impatient and ready to call it a day, but I pushed on.

# Thursday, April 01, 2010 — Jenny's Knob Shelter
**Start Location:** Jenkins Shelter
**Miles Today:** 23.80
**Trip Miles:** 588.90

Highs: My highest point of the day, I think, was deciding to make 9 miles in 3 hours and DOING IT, despite uphill terrain and sore feet. I just pushed and pushed, invigorated by cool night air and a big bag of walnuts, almonds, and cranberries (my power food, I think). I also enjoyed lounging by the river for what seemed like all afternoon. Lastly, finding Storm Crow in the shelter that night was a pleasant surprise. He gave me some trail mix because I was hungry from hiking and all out of food. I got to hear Storm Crow talk about his hobby: medieval battle. Since his 20's he's been dressing as a "3rd to 4th Century Germanic warrior" and battling against other characters with dull weapons. It's called Live Action Warfare (LAW) or something like that, and well-dressed Americans trade their collared shirts and slacks for a full medieval suit of armor and a weapon to match. All fighting styles gather in field and forest for an eclectic battle of epic proportions, and afterwards they brew up a massive pot of stew and drink punch. Storm Crow was knocked unconscious once, he said, by a blow dealt by the catan of a Japanese Samurai, and brought him into his tent afterwards for a drink [That's right, he owns a authentic medievel tent]. In the heat of battle, if you're hit in the arm you can't use it anymore. Hit in the leg? You've got to hop. The chest or neck? You're dead. It all sounded pretty awesome. Wesley, Sean and I have dealt full blows before with wooden shafts in our lacrosse pads, but doing it with practice and precision sounds awesome. Not to mention charging into enemy lines with 500 fellow warriors.
Lows: Eating all my food, though relaxing, makes me feel like crap. I do it anyway out of an incontrollable hunger instinct, and it does give me fuel for afternoon hiking. But that was my low of the day. Also, the first 5 miles was painful on my feet.

# Friday, April 02, 2010 — Woods Hole Hostel
**Start Location:** Jenny's Knob Shelter
**Miles Today:** 21
**Trip Miles:** 609.90

The highs included eating and lounging outside a convenience store after a morning of aching hunger. I had 2 slices of pizza, 2 gatorades, a candybar, and a bag of nuts. A stray puppy kept wandering out of an old barn and barking at me. I'd ignore him and he'd tip-toe back into the barn. Local lumbermill workers on lunch-break sat quietly at a picnic table nearby. I layed over and fell asleep. Storm Crow walked up shortly after with a 6-pack of Yuengling. He called for a shuttle to the Woods Hole Hostel, and he drank and talked about 4 "pretty recent" hiker murders in the area.
I set off from there into the Dismal Creek lowlands, a labrytnh of creeks and rhododenron where the murders took place. The murderer had known the area well, and had taken back passages to sneak around the hikers and ambush them and escape afterwards. I was paranoid, and kept hearing sounds of ATVs or pickups through the woods. Or maybe it was just the creek. I was sweating heavily and took a bath in the stream, feeling like someone was watching me.
Several miles later, I realized I'd left my map at the creek where I bathed. The map had all my scheduled stops starred, so I imagined the killer following my tracks and pciking up the map with a sick grin. Up the trail I stopped at Watipi Shelter, where some guy shot cans with a pellet gun and showed off his knife and machete. The other fellow there was named "Know-Nothing", because he didn't want to know anything new on the trail. I ate and moved on to Woods Hole Shelter.
The sun set and my headlight flicked on. I was paranoid still as I approached Sugar Run Road, where the killer had crashed his car in escape. My light was dim and rocks difficult to hike on. I extinguished my light near the road and approached under the cover of darkness. Keep in mind, this road was a totally isolated forest road. At the clearing, my map lay on the ground. That's right: my lost map 10 miles ahead, right on the trail. The killer! He'd found my map, and taken a back road ahead of me! My heart stopped. he must be watching me. It was a half-mile down the road to Woods Hole Hostel, so I snatched the map and took of running. Immediatly, I saw a car parked facing towards me, lights off. This was it. He was waiting in the car for me. Instinctually, I darted to the left and charged the car with my hiking poles out to stab. But the car was empty. Still on edge, I took off running again down the road. Headlights beamed around the bend, so flicked off my light and crashed down into a ravine. The car drove by. I remounted the road and took off running again. Soon I saw lights and ran up to the hostel. A bonfire was burning and hikers gathered around it. I was sweating and out of breath. My feet pounded. Someone brought me a beer and sat down. In a minute, the car came back down and pulled into the driveway. The owner got out. She'd come up to fetch me from the trailhead, and I apologized. "I'd of dived off the road too!," he said. BY the way, that beer was a high of the day.

# Saturday, April 03, 2010 — A cabin (Pearisburg, VA)
**Start Location:** Woods Hole Hostel
**Miles Today:** 10
**Trip Miles:** 619.90

Highs: Seeing my FAMILY! They met me on the trail down from Angel's Rest, the lookout above Pearisburg. From up the trail, I heard their voices down below. That was the high of my day. I ran down full tilt, crashing with a sweaty hug into my little sister. We laughed and yipped. Then I ran down to my mother and tried not to cry with joy. I didn't understand why I wanted to cry, but then again I don't really understand alot about myself. I hugged my Dad, and we all sat down for lunch on the trail. I was ontop of the world.
Later that night we played memory with Dawson, Corey and Morgan, had an awesome conversation about grandparents over my Mom's spaghetti dinner, and watched everyone go to bed. I stayed up to sort out food and pack. The soft bed that night was awesome.
Lows: Everything up to meeting my family on the trail sucked. My feet pounded with pain and I groaned aloud. I tried to be happy becuase my family was waiting ahead, but I just couldn't muster up a smile. I imagined seeing them and saying, "Hold on guys, I just need to keep hiking and get this over with," then hiking on to the bottom. It was very painful. Also, having to divy up my next week's provisions that night sucked, because it was a stressful task that ate of precious time with my family.

# Sunday, April 04, 2010 — Rendezevous Motel (Pearisburg, VA)
**Start Location:** A cabin (Pearisburg, VA)
**Miles Today:** 0
**Trip Miles:** 619.90

Highs: My mother and I woke up early and we hung out together in the cabin kitchen. I love that time with my Mom. She made a huge breakfast of pancakes, eggs and bacon. We packed up and left the cabin and drove into Pearisburg to do some shopping. My Dad and I did a small section of hiking and my Mom and sister staked out a cool spot for lunch. We all went to the New River boat landing and lunched by the river under the bridge. It was cool there in the shade with a light breeze. It was like heaven. Everything I wanted in life was there, it seemed, sitting by the river. We threw skipped rocks and talked about nothing at all. I wish I was back there right now.
Lows: Saying goodbye at the motel sucked. It ached my heart like leaving Springer all over again, and there was nothing I could do about it. That's a funny feeling, waving off the car and closing the motel door on something you desire with all your heart. It ached like love lost. I turned on the TV to take my mind off it all, and flicked to a murder scene in a horror flick. That unsettled me even more. That night sucked.

Highs: My high was hiking in a crazy thunderstorm that night. The lightening exploded over my head in the darkness, thunder matching flash. The air smelled rich and metallic, which exhilerated me. After coving 20-some miles, it was a invigorating ending to a painful day. I got lost and heard voices as the storm cleared, so I called out, "HELLO!". I saw flashlights ahead. The shelter! "Is that Uncle Frank?," said a voice. It was TwoCan, the guy who had given me the beer at Woods Hole. Another high was sleeping at the shelter on the sunny bald and dreaming of home.
Lows: I left the motel and called my Mother, which made me feel like crap. I missed home so much and didn't know what to do. The first half of the day was painful inside and out.

**Start Location:** Niday Shelter
**Miles Today:** 27.10
**Trip Miles:** 696.40

High: Today's high was probably seeing a pretty girl on her way up to Dragon's Tooth, south of Catawba. She was with another VT student, a lean guy who would probably be good at ultimate frisbee. She, herself, was fit and strong, also probably good at frisbee. Both were really nice and kind of glowed, balanced in that they didn't give off any more light than they were willing to take in. I chatted with them for 5 maybe 10 minutes then moved on, but their fresh spirit stayed wit me. I had been feeling pretty low. As I descended I could see them on top of the Tooth. "Thank You." I wanted to yell. I moved along quietly. At the gap I walked down to the store to buy a can of Mountain Dew and a 25 cent pack of gum. Near dusk I moved on. I passed a girl in her late twenties by the creek. She'd stopped for the last night of her first camping trip ever, a five day trek. I admired her courage. Being out in the woods in scary, even for a seasoned hiker like myself. She said she wanted to hike the AT one day. I told her firmly that she could.
Darkness wore on from there, by the creek, across the pasture and into the woods. I felt alright, alright enough to keep up a steady 3 mph pace. The next shelter was 8 miles away. I got to the road at 9:30. It was a usy road, loud and mean in the night. This area was a popular local hang-out, so already I was on edge. the random shootings along the Blue Ridge Parkway - I'd seen on the newspaper at the store - were fresh on my mind, adding to the tension. Just before crossing, I heard a sound in the woods by the road. It was louder than a deer and quicker than a bear, and immediately I decided it was a human. And not just a human: a crazed killer waited to murder night-hikers. I flicked off my flashlight and waited. The sound stopped. I took off running, across the road and back in to the woods. He's following me, I said to myself. He's gonna follow me to the next shelter. I hoofed quickly to the shelter a mile in , hoping to find it packed with hikers. It was empty. Dead quiet. I quickly moved on the next shelter, another mile in. I heard a single gunshot on the way: the killer had arrived at the first shelter to murder me and shot the wall in frustration when he found it empty. The next shelter was empty, too. On to the next shelter, 2.5 miles away. On the way, I heard another gunshot meaning the killer had arrived at the second shelter.
At McAfee Knob, just before the third shelter, I could see Roanoke glowing, the valley like gold glittering on the ocean floor. An incredible view. I awaited an ambush from the killer, who'd taken the fire road and beat me to the top. At the third shelter, I found two kids sleeping in a tent and felt like I'd beat the killer. I was out of range. I ate some cold oatmeal and went to sleep. It was 12:15am.

# Thursday, April 08, 2010 — Travelodge Motel (Daleville, VA)
**Start Location:** Campbell Shelter
**Miles Today:** 17
**Trip Miles:** 713.40

Gnats buzzed in my hair when I awoke. It was only 6:45am, but with the sunrise came heat and bugs so I couldn't sleep. I talked with the kids in the tent as I packed up, and I was on the trail by 7:30. It was a hot, hot day, and my feet were in alot of pain. By the time I got to Lambert's Meadow Shelter, I was ready for a long break. I drank from the stream and washed my body, then took a long nap in the shelter shade. I soaked my shirt and bandana and drapped them over my chest and head, put on my long pants, and went to sleep bug-proofed. I woke up to a dad and his kids arriving from the north. They were two smart kids with a good strong dad who was trying to make them as strong as he. And he was doing a fine job. I told them I was out of food and he accused me of yogi-ing. I retorted, "If I was yogi-ing, I'd be alot smoother than that." What I meant to say was that if I'm yogi-ing I'd ask you straight up for food.
Clouds covered the sun and I moved on at noon for Daleville, 9 miles away. the hike flew by and the hunger wasn't as bad as the foot pain. By the last mile, I was in so much pain. My four blisters were on fire and my foot pads bruised. I hobbled off the trail to a convenience store to buy a gatorade, then hobbled to the Outfitter to use the computer, then hobbled to the the Three Little Pigs BBQ for dinner. The meal was amazing - fried onion strips and buffalo chips with a big mound of both the tomato and vinegar BBQ and a 1/2 pint of Magic Hat Lager. The BEST meal since the steak with Dad, and the best BBQ ever. I hung at the Outfitter for almost four hours after, reading and writing and chatting with the manager, while rain pounded outside. My mom called their phone and we coordinated Dawson, Caleb and Michael's visit. It was still pouring rain at closing time, so I bribed a ride to the motel from the employee wit ha 6-pack of Miller Lite.
That night I wrote and showered and ate three apples.

# Friday, April 09, 2010 — Fullhardt Knob Shelter
**Start Location:** Travelodge Motel (Daleville, VA)
**Miles Today:** 4.90
**Trip Miles:** 718.30

High: An all-you-can-eat breakfast at Shoney's was up on the list, but I must say the high was seeing Caleb, Dawson, and Michael pull to a stop in front of the outfitter after waiting for them all day in Troutville. We all hugged and walked over for an expensive (yet totally worth-it) BBQ dinner at Three Little Pigs. We joked with the waitress and laughed at nothing in particular. It was a grand ol' time, and the adventure hadn't even really begun. It was 9:15 PM when we walked back out to the car and sorted out the gear for the hike under the lamplight. By 10:00 PM we were on the trail, a line of dim headlamps inching towards Fullhardt Knob Shelter.
Caleb, Dawson and Michael were all sturdy hikers--sturdier than I expected, in fact--and we arrived in good time that night (by "good time" I mean 12:15 am). I bore Caleb's backpack, my rusty old Kelty external-frame from my Boy Scout days. It was loaded with 50+ lbs. of stuff, an entirely foreign level of stress to my feet. Bone structure clearly disturbed, I could feel them groaning in my tennis-shoes like an old ship in a storm. Just outside of Troutville, we cut off the headlamps and crossed a hilly pasture, big and black under a dim blue spread of starlit sky above.
That night was Caleb and Dawson's first night in an A.T. shelter, which really excited me. It was late and I was tired. I was the first asleep.

# Saturday, April 10, 2010 — Cove Mountain Shelter
**Start Location:** Fullhardt Knob Shelter

**Trip Miles:** 738.30

We rose late the next morning, I repeating my eat-and-return-to-sleep cycle several times before actually rising. The others had no real schedule or "hiking routine", so we all just kind of took our time. We left the shelter by 11:15, passing Drip-Dry and Reveille who had hiked the 5 miles from town early that morning. We stopped at a waterfall and stream several miles down the trail. There, we all layed down for a long and sleepy break in the sun. I ate, Caleb and Dawson smoked a cigar, and Michael puffed on his pipe; we all slept. I was in bliss. I will never forget that long, warm hour by the stream. 
On we hiked, passing the Blue Ridge Parkway for the first time. Again, we stopped to eat and sleep in the sun. It was heaven. I was drifting off when I heard a voice: "Are yall thru-hikers?." I opened my eyes and looked back. A car was pulled up and a thin, scruffy kid hung out the passenger window. "I am," I said, "I'm Uncle Frank." As it turns out, it was Knee-Deep, another thru-hiker I'd heard a great deal about on the trail. He'd been a day or so behind me for months, he said, and was about to catch up. Today, however, he was spending on the parkway with his girlfriend. He said he'd plan to catch me in a couple of days, and I said I'd be looking forward to it. Off he drove. Off I went back to sleep.
Near dusk we pulled off at a shelter for dinner, SWEET POTATOES! We made a roaring kindling fire and dumped the foil-wrapped 'taters in the coals. Fifty minutes later, we each had a piping hot meal in our hands. We ate and night grew. By 8:00, we were on the trail again. The climb was grueling, but by 10:30 we were at the next shelter. Again, I fell asleep quickly. Later that night, I awoke to the sound of Caleb throwing up. I got out of my bag, grabbed some trail mix, ate it, then went back to sleep. Caleb was still vomiting, yet I was surprisingly indifferent. To me, upchucking is a good thing.

I'll just do highs and lows today. The high was hiking with the boys down to the river. I really did love the company and I dreaded losing it, but there was nothing I could do as Caleb, Dawson and Michael drove off. That was the low. In fact, the rest of the day was low. I hiked slowly and indifferently, covering only 17-some miles and intermittently napping because it took my mind off my depression. It was just a hard day. Several highs, however: I saw a pretty wildflower bed along the trail, and I arrived at the shelter before dark. I thought about calling Haywood and telling him, "I know what you mean: M.A.I.D."

I'd run out of food the day before and had 15 miles to cover to access my mail-drop in Glasgow, VA. My hunger wasn't too bad, neither hurting nor slowing me down noticeably. The trail was smooth and hot, and it reminded me of the trails out in New Mexico. I felt good. High up on the ridge, I spotted the James River, flowing mightily in the valley. I hollered in joy. Not only was it a symbol of home, it was the location of the road to Glasgow and thus a symbol of food. I called my Dad and we set up a mail-drop and talked about meeting up in Harper's Ferry. I missed him. Down into the valley the trees bloomed and leafed, making a tunnel of neon-green light. It was magnificent. The red-buds were blooming in their explosive purples and the maple leaves were glowing verdantly. I took photos of wildflowers and cool leaves. At the river, I was bubbly. I ran across the footbridge just as a freight train ran across on a nearby trestle. The sun poured down on the river. It was all so glorious. I yipped and hollered uncontrollably like a little kid.
At the road I stuck out my thumb and an under-cover cop pulled over. "Hitchhiking is illegal anywhere in Virginia," he said. He background checked by ID and gave me a ride into town in the back of his souped-up Dodge Charger. I sat in the back where they put the criminals, fidgeting on hard plastic seats meant to tell them: You're screwed, and these seats are just the beginning. The cop was nice, and asked me question after question. At the store, I bought some chocolate milk and picked up my mail-drop, and the cop gave me a ride back to the trailhead.
I hauled up the food 1.7 miles to a shelter, where I sat down for a gorge to remember. I chugged chocolate milk and consumed an entire loaf of homemade banana bread, then passed out for an hour. I awoke feeling great.
I lounged at the shelter for at least an hour, until Knee-Deep came strolling down the trail. "Theerrreee he is," he said. "Now I can finally stop." He'd been hiking for 28 miles already that day in order to catch me, and after exchanging trail news and whatnot we both moved on 7 miles to the next shelter. The shelter is located near the site of an unexplained murder of 4 year-old Ottie Bundren in the 1890's, and it's apprently haunted. We left some chocolate by the gravestone where they found her body to pacify the ghost. I slept well that night.

**Start Location:** Punchbowl Shelter
**Miles Today:** 25.30
**Trip Miles:** 805.90

We left camp at sunrise, before 6:45 am. The first several hours of hiking were difficult. My feet hurt and morale was low, but being with Knee-Deep helped a lot. We talked most of the time, exchanging stories and sharing experiences. Then we'd go silent before resuming talk. Trail talk is a funny mode of communication. It's entirely aimless and self-centered, bouncing mindlessly from one subject to the next. For example:
Knee-Deep: "I love dogs."
Me: "Yea, I want to get a pit bull one day."
Knee-Deep: "My Uncle has a pit bull. He has like ten Siamese cats, too"
Me: "Oooo, my neighbors had some Siamese cats. They were awesome."
And so on...

Knee-Deep needed to resupply, so I waited on a picnic table in the sun while he hitched into town. I gave him $10 and asked him to get me "something meaty" at the Subway. He came back in 2 hours, I ate my sub, and we marched on. We passed Cold Mountain, my old stomping ground, and took in some awesome views. The views in Virginia have been like no other: I'm proud to call this state "home."
At the shelter (it was dark by then), we found an older fellow sleeping with his two wily pit bulls. They growled at us but were a cute, innocent pair of pups. Someone had left a bag of food, so I ate three bags of oatmeal before falling asleep.

# Wednesday, April 14, 2010 — Reed's Gap
**Start Location:** Seely-Woodworth Shelter
**Miles Today:** 22.30
**Trip Miles:** 828.20

The next morning I was dragging painfully once again. We stopped in the fog for a climb to a view less Spy Rock, then made our way to The Priest Shelter. After the climb up Spy Rock I was feeling brighter. The fog was thick and soaked everything. At the shelter, we laughed at the trail register, where, going with the "Priest" theme, people had left all sorts of confessions (mostly about skipping miles and not paying at hostels). They were hilarious. From there, we dropped off the edge of The Priest into the valley below. There, the Tye River paralleled a highway, and we walked down the road to get chocolate and soda and hitched back. The climb up from the valley to Three Ridges wasn't as bad as we expected (we'd been dreading it all day). The views were spectacular on top. I took some amazing photos and was in high spirits.
A side note: when I say "high spirits", I mean a sort of bursting joy that I scarcely find in civilization. It's a strange mix of physical exhaustion, emotional exhilaration, and mental consolidation. I'll miss that when this is all through.
Knee-Deep and I had planned to stay at Rusty's Hard-Time Hollow, but we decided to move on to cowboy camp. There were plenty of awesome overlooks, and we hiked into the night for an hour before finding a great spot at Reed's Gap. It was a 360-degree view of the mountains and stars. We bedded down on the grass and fell asleep.
P.S. Where's God been the last several weeks? I don't know...surely not loud like before.

**Start Location:** Reed's Gap
**Miles Today:** 28
**Trip Miles:** 856.20

As usual, getting started that day was hard. I always drag in the mornings. My right foot was killing me. Knee-Deep's snoring that night had kept my awake, so I was doubly tired as well. Also, I was hungry and out of food. Knee-Deep gave some to me, but my stomach was still grumbling. Those were all the lows.
The highs were plenty, as I ended the day in C'ville. But first, running 8 miles before 4:45 was a rewarding yet painful event. That made my day. Wesley picked me up from there and took us (Knee-Deep hung back and we picked him up at I-64) out to dinner at the A.Y.C.E. dining hall, and I drank Legends Brown Ale and listened to the Avett Brothers that evening. There was a frat party, but I didn't feel like going. It was an awesome night.

# Saturday, April 24, 2010 — Blackburn Trail Center
**Start Location:** Bear's Den Hostel
**Miles Today:** 8
**Trip Miles:** 997.80

It was raining when I left the gazebo at Bear's Den. Several miles into the last leg of the "Roller Coaster", I hid from the wind and crawled under a slab of stone for a nap. I woke up feeling discouraged and angry. I planned on meeting Sean in Harper's Ferry that day (18 miles), but a mid-day stop at Blackburn Trail Center became my stop for the night. Here's why: Cold, hungry and above all immensely bored of walking (to the point of anger), I arrived at Blackburn after a measely 8 miles from Bear's Den. The the door a lady loaded groceries from the car trunk, and I offered a hand. Rita was a long-time ATC employee who now works with local schoolteachers to incorporate the Appalachian Trail into the curriculum. That very moment, a high school group was hiking towards the Trail Center for an end-of-semester field trip. They would hike in, spend the night, and hike out the next day. Rita was unloading groceries to feed the group, and she tried convince me to stay for dinner while feeding me strawberries, cheese, and salad greens. The kids would love to meet a thru-hiker, she said. Her food bribe worked and I called Sean to change plans.
Sean arrived around dusk and we ate with the group. After dinner, we drove to Harper's Ferry and skateboarded around town and drank beer by the railroad tracks. A train flattened a penny and I decided I'd carry it the rest of the way to Maine. On the way home we did some doughnuts in a field and stopped to shoot pellets at empty cans.
It was a great night, and I really appreciated all the energy Sean brought into a phase in my hike which, at the moment, was feeling pretty drab.

# Sunday, April 25, 2010 — Harper's Ferry Hostel
**Start Location:** Blackburn Trail Center
**Miles Today:** 12.50
**Trip Miles:** 1010.30

Sean and I slept in the car that night. We got up, yogi-ed from pineapple juice and scrambled eggs from the high school group. By 9 o'clock we were hiking on the AT to a gap 5 miles away, where a parent chaperone kindly agreed to shuttle Sean's car. Sean and had some good conversation, which honestly we don't do much of. When I'm with Sean it's alot of action and not alot of idle chit-chat, but a causual hike was a good combination of the two.
For the first time in the trip, I decided to skip a 7-mile section from the road to Harper's Ferry, so Sean and I drove into town to eat and drop me off at the hostel for the night. A quick disclaimer on the trail-skipping: First of all, I ended up going back that day and hiking the section, so I didn't end up skipping any miles. It was less guilt than boredom that led me to hitch back to the trail (after a thousand miles my trail-morals are going gray). I just didn't feel like sitting around the hostel until the owner returned.
Well, the rest of the hike was nice. I trail-ran most of the way (with no food my pack was light as a feather), stopping every couple minutes to listen to the thunder of a a swift-approaching thunderstorm. At the Potomac River I yipped and yelled and danced across the bridge. Cars honked at me and I honked back. I was excited because Harper's Ferry was the half-way point, and I was crossing into it. One of those trip milestones. 
At Harper's Ferry the storm hit. I still had 4 miles to cover, including a time-consuming stop to register as a "thru-hiker" at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy HQ. I chatted with lady at the AT HQ and decided that, though she was maybe 40, I would have asked her on a date had the time been right. Nomads don't go on dates. 
Lightning exploded overhead and torrential rain came rushing down the old stone steps into downtown Harper's Ferry (the trail passes right through town). I thought about the probability of being struck and decided it wasn't high enough to warrant a stop, so I kept hiking towards the hostel.
The storm cleared and I arrived at the hostel at dusk. I sure do love a post-storm evening, when the air smells like rain and lightening and the birds aren't sure if they should come back out or call it for the night. At the hostel I tore into a maildrop and chowed on a bag of home-made muffins (THANKS MA!!!). I greeted Kevin, my Smoky-Mountains hiking partner, after nearly 2 months of separation. Pancakes were free, so I cooked a couple before bed. Kevin, Muffin-Mit and I planned to hike 40 miles the next day (a.k.a. the Maryland Challenge, where hikers enter Maryland from W.Va and leave it into Penn. in the same 40-mile day.).

A rainy day and lonely hike to Pine Knob. Failed the Maryland Challenege thanks to a big pancake breakfast, a late start, and a steady, disheartening downpour throughout the day. Talked to myself in Spanish and a New Zealand accent for several hours out of boredom. Spent an hour in a shelter writing a rap song while the lightening passed. Got the Pine Knob in the dark.

A really crappy day. I'd been excited at the hostel to run into two fellow thru-hikers (I was desperate for some company for motivation), but one was already a day ahead and another a day behind. I was alone again, and it had it's effects. I trudged along all day, eating way too much food and covering way too few miles. I stopped at the trailhead leading to Devil's Racecourse Shelter and didn't even have the motivation to walk the 0.3 miles to the shelter itself, so I rolled out my sleeping bag right there and fell asleep for the night. What a bad day.

# Wednesday, April 28, 2010 — Tumbling Run Shelters

**Trip Miles:** 1059.50

Met up with the Georgia boys today. Like a dream-come-true, the caught up to me near the Pennsylvania-Maryland border as I stood on the railroad tracks looking dazed and confused (which I was). An hour before, I'd curled up in a bathroom in a park and awoken to a old man poking me with his trash-picker. "Wake up! What are you doing here," he demanded. I told him the wind was cold and I was a tired hiker, and he told me to fetch some fried chicken and a half-drinken bottle of lemonade. I had a piece left, and I gave it to the Georgia boys to split. Reckless and Boomerang were they're names, and I let out a sigh of relief: I'd found some good hiking partners at last.
We hiked to the Tumbling Run Shelters that night, only a 13 mile day for me but a 26 mile day for them. There were two shelters, one for "SNORING" and the other labeled "NON-SNORING". Boomerang carries a guitar, so he played an old Texas tune as I drifted to sleep. I slept outside the shelter on the picnic table and woke up to some brilliant stars.

A good day with the Georgia boys. I left early and hiked the first 10 miles alone, and at noon we met up and hiked together for the last 16 miles. During our lunchbreak, we bummmed fresh milk, carrots, bananas, and pretzels off a state-sponsored pre-school group that had extra. "They give us way too much food," said the chaperone. A black girl about our age swatted at gnats and asked us how we'd spend 2 months in the woods. "I'm like...*swat*...like I can't stand it out here!," she said. We laughed. We talked about how much we'd like to see a pretty girl, and Reckless produced a zip-lock back. He showed us a photo of his pretty girlfriend and unzipped the bag to let us smell the contents, a perfumed-scented letter from her. He smiled proudly.
We made it to the shelter in good time that night, and I boiled water over the fire with my pot. I was hungry and out of food (thanks to gorging 2 days before), and I went to bed with my stomach growling. The next morning, we planned to pass the official halfway point of the AT (Milepost 1089.55) and continue three miles into Pine Furnace State Park to accomplish the "Half-Gallon Challenge". As tradition goes, thru-hikers mark the mid-point by consuming an absurd amount of ice-cream.
"I'm listening to Boomerang sing 'Ain't Never Gonna Be Satisfied' on his guitar, and I'm thinking about the 1/2 Gallon Challenge tomorrow and wondering how true that is," said my entry into the shelter logbook.

A good hard day of hiking. After waiting around until noon for the owner of the general store, we abandoned the "1/2 Gallon Challenge" and started hiking. For nearly 7 hours we hiked hard, racing across the 22 miles to Boiling Springs. I was ahead of the Georgia Boys by an hour, and I met up with a couple at Boiling Springs and they invited me for a picnic. Fresh flatbread with roastbeef, cheese and mustard, triscuts with hummus, grapes and an apple, fig-newtons, and several cups of fruit juice! I thanked them and moved on around sunset. This area, called the Cumberland Gap, was the first break in mountains on the AT. The Georgia Boys stayed in town, but I ambled along into the night down narrow corridors of woods between huge corn fields. I stopped to watch a big fireworks show by some locals. I slept in a field under the moon and stars. Tomorrow, I'd meet up with my dad.

**Start Location:** north of Boiling Springs
**Miles Today:** 20.70
**Trip Miles:** 1133.80

Hiked relentlessly through the heat to meet my Dad at the gap by noon. Stopped to get some water from a farm hose and a cyclist rode by and said, "You're not going to get there by sitting here!". Thanks, man.
From the shade I saw a day-hiker walk by. Yes! The motivation of company! I followed behind the day-hiker, a local lawyer, to ride out my exhaustion. Several miles from the gap, I took off running and made it just as my Dad pulled up. We hugged, laughed, high-fived, and hugged again. It was good to feel back home again, even it I was in Pennslyvania.
The rest of the hike was only 10 miles, but I was struggling. The sprint to meet my Dad had bruised my feet, so I was in alot of pain as we climbed the last ridge before Duncannon. It was great being with Dad, however. His dry humor and lemonade-out-of-lemons attitude really kept me going. He also got to see me feeling crappy and how I dealt with it, which I appreciated. Now he knows.
We limped into town and got Gatorades, and it was the best-tasting Gatorate I've ever had. Maybe it was the heat, maybe it was the hunger, but I swear it was the best Gatorade I've ever had. We got to his car, and ate Mom's blond-brownies on the way to the hotel. That night we went to an Italian resaurant to eat. I had an AWESOME grilled salmon. We got coffee afterwards, bought some atheletic shorts and new socks, and hung out at the bookstore until 11. I stayed up until 2:30 getting my iPod all "synced". That's right, Ford Prior has let an iPod infiltrate his pure, all-natural AT "vision-quest". Let me just say this: it's necessity, okay? I'm about to die of boredome here. The other day I told a lady I was bored out of my mind and she said, "How do you get bored of these beautiful woods?!" I bit my tongue but wished to say, "Listen, lady: YOU hike 1,000+ miles and then come talk to me."

I took my sleeping medicine for the first time in 2+ weeks and I slept great that night.

**Start Location:** Red Roof Inn (Duncannon, PA)
**Miles Today:** 11.20
**Trip Miles:** 1145

I woke up early, about 6:30, and was stirring around. Dad got up quick like he always used to do, looking in need of a cup of coffee yet somehow also ready for the day. I love waking up with Dad. It reminds me of getting up at sunrise with him at the beach and taking long walks along the surf.
Dad went and got some coffee while I packed up my things. We got in the car and drove to Cracker Barrel. I had 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, and 2 pancakes logged with maple syrup. We laughed and joked around.
Next we drove to the grocery. I needed a resupply, and so Dad and I walked the aisles with a 4-day food plan written on a wrinkled notepad. It was a surprisingly tedious and consequently stressful affair. Each item's location in the store had nothing to do with the other items' locations. No easy A,B,C, arrangement; no map to follow; few employees to show the way. I left the grocery feeling wound up and taking a deep breath.
It was 11:00 am. I was to hit the trail at 2:30, so Dad and I spend the next couple hours lounging at the bookstore. He patiently read a book while I updated my journal and drank coffee. Outside, the clouds looked ominous; heavy rains were fore casted for the afternoon. For an hour or two we hung out in the bookstore. I wish we could've chatted and played putt-putt or something.
It was time to part ways, and I could feel in my stomach. We got 5 Guys for lunch and drove back to Duncannon. I hated it, sitting there about to leave, taping my feet and packing my pack with Dad right there. "Wanna get a beer?" I pleaded. No, he said. I had to get going. We hugged and I said "Damn it" and shook my head. It really sucked, and I kept shaking my head as I turned and walked off. Too bad I had to go my way and he had to go his. Too bad we couldn't of just gone together. I love my Dad, man. I've said it before and I'll say it again: he's my best friend.
It was 4:00 PM and I waited for the downpour. Skies were gloomy and loaded with wetness. For 11 miles I walked with ease, listening to a Fleet Foxes album and a Corey Widmer sermon about wisdom. "The sages of Proverbs say that there are two paths before us: the path of Life and the path of Death," he said. He said our walk is a crooked march for Life that always draws like a magnet towards the path of Death. As we stumble between the two paths, we're confronted by situations that confuse us. These situations are entirely unique. They're unhelped by extensive self-help knowledge and generally-accepted tricks and unhelped by an understanding of black-and-white lines of morality. That is, these situations need WISDOM from above because Self-Help books and the 10 Commandments don't cut it. He mentioned that wisdom is a path to follow, not just some door to open. I took off my iPod and decided to listen to the birds (a little wiser, eh?). 
The rain held off on me all the way to the shelter. Only at the very end did it come down. At the shelter I met up with Reckless and Boomerang, including 2 flip-floppers and another thru-hiker named Muffin-Mittens. I broke out the banana bread from Mom and everyone dug in. 
The rain came down hard that night, and I filled up my water bottle with brown-tinted rainwater pouring from the gutters. Unhealthy? Most likely.

**Start Location:** Peters Mountain Shelter

**Trip Miles:** 1163

Oh, what a day. I left before 7am, while the rest were still asleep. The rain was gone but the forest was dripping and moist, and sharp-toothed gnats swarmed my face (these gnats are a bold species, unafraid to kamakazi into the ears and eyes). For some reason I was very tired, so I covered myself with a poncho and laid down for a nap nearly 10 miles into the day. I got up again, and again was overwhelmed with sleepiness. By mid-morning the last of the northbound pack passed me. I woke up and tried to catch up but still fatigue struck me down. Let me say here that it's times like these that I hate my narcolepsy; it's times like these that if feels like a real disability. I don't get angry at it. I just feel wronged by it sometimes.
After my 3rd nap, I woke up and began walking. If I walked fast enough, I'd catch the group taking their lunchbreak. Well, I walked in the wrong direction...for 1.5 hours. I ran into Sampson (the flip-flopper), who I thought had passed me. "Hey man, did you turn around?" I said, quickly realizing by his face that something was amiss. "You're not heading North, are you?". He affirmed. I cursed aloud several times in front of Sampson, thanked him, and turned around. I cursed again and again. Between 6 and 8 miles lost. I was very angry. Rain showers came and went.
Just before sundown I arrived at Rausch Gap Shelter. Sampson was there (he passed me during another nap) with another flip-flopper named Rewind. I ate and put up my feet. It would be another 14 miles to catch the others, and 14 miles meant a long night of hiking. HYOH (Hike Your Own Hike), I said to myself: I just didn't feel like moving along. It was a bad day and it felt better at the shelter. Happily, I shucked off the guilt of not hiking on and settled down for the night. That decision redeemed my day. By the way, Rausch Gap Shelter is awesome. Someone built a spring-fed retangular dish that constantly overflows with cold water. That night I slept great.

# Tuesday, May 04, 2010 — The Pavilion (Port Clinton, PA)
**Start Location:** Rausch Gap Shelter
**Miles Today:** 42
**Trip Miles:** 1205

That's right: 42 miles! Hard to believe but here it goes:
It all started with a fresh start at sunrise. At the shelter the orange sun broke through the green canopy. The air was moist and filled with energy. I hit the trail at 6:45 and listened to my iPod for about an hour while munching on Muenster cheese. I stopped under an overpass for a 40-minute nap at about 9:15 am. An hour later, I had to throw my pack over a deep stream and leap over (kinda fun). For the 13 miles between my nap and the shelter I felt great. It was about noon, and I decided that I'd catch up that night. 42 was a big number, but I didn't really think about that. I just decided to go and went.
At the 501 Shelter I found some instant coffee mix and shook up at water bottle of extremely-strong brew, probably as powerful as an espresso. I ate sunflower seeds and sipped on the potion as I march on. No foot or joint problems, no debilitating sleepiness. I felt strong as a bull. I never listened to my iPod. I was fine without it, rather enjoying rapping to myself with surprising flow (I'm secretly convinced that I could be a rapper if I tried). A strange isolated storm blew up from nowhere and narrowly missed me. 
It was almost dusk and I was about 16 miles from Port Clinton. I found myself staring at the sky at a road crossing, and suddenly an SUV came speeding akwardly towards me IN REVERSE. The car had slammed on the brakes and reversed back up to meet, and an Amish-looking bearded man rolled down the window. "You thru-hiking?" I said yes. "How does a fresh hot meal sound?". "Ahhhhh," I said, "I'm kinda on a time schedule. It's already going to be a late night." Then I paused and thought: you know, this may never happen again. Meanwhile, his son stared awkwardly. "You now what, screw it man! I'd love a hot meal." I hopped in. 
His name was Longnecker, and this was "Longnecker Country," he said. Sure enough, we passed his brother's house, his father's house, his sister's house, and the homes of several other family members on the way to Longnecker's place. It sat on the hilltop with a beautiful view of the valley. He had an enormous family, I guess a tradition of the Church of the Bretheren. I waded through kids to get from the car to the front door--actually, they kind of parted for me and stared curiously as I walked through. Upon entering the house (of modest size, I should note), Longnecker told his wife that "I've brought home a hiker! Can you hurry up? He needs to get back to the trail." She was a kind woman. Before dinner, I sat on the couch and talked to Longnecker. At least 10 kids surrounded us and listened quietly. At dinner call we all seated ourselves around a large table. Enchiladas, a salad, cookies, and a glass of milk was the dinner, and it was DELICIOUS. Everyone (even both parents), dipped their cookies in the milk. In fact, the mother even broke up a cookie for the smallest child and dipped it in for her! I thought that was interesting. A "thank you" and back to the trail.
For the first hour I listened to the iPod, but soon darkness fell and I put it away (the night always makes me paranoid). It was a long and hard 16 miles but at last it was over. I trudged proudly into the shelter at 12:30 AM and collapsed. My feet were in bad shape, which I only realized after stopping for several minutes. The skin was white and blisters blood-red. I looked in the trashcan: three half-empty ice cream containers told me the boys had attempted the "Half-Gallon Challenge" and failed miserably. I polished off a box of cookie dough and fell asleep.

In the morning my feet were really feeling the 42 miles from the day (night) before. My legs, too. We took a late start and walked over to 3 C's Diner for some pancakes and eggs. By 11:30 we left Port Clinton for Allentown, only 23 miles away.
I napped at the first shelter and everyone passed me (as usual). I wasn't concerned by being behind, and lounged at the shelter for over an hour. The rest of the day was nice and kind of boring. You know, I'm kinda getting used to these long boring days in the sunlight. The gnats were obnoxious and I did get immensely bored with myself, but overall it wasn't so bad. I didn't even listen to the iPod much. I saw a couple day-hikers but not many people. The terrain was mild. For the last 2 hours I listened to the Lewis & Clark audiobook (Undaunted Courage), but at nightfall I cut it off. For 30 minutes I walked over sharp stones in near-darkness, impressed with my own depth-perception in dim light. When I saw the shelter I almost giggled with joy. I joked with the boys and ate some jerky before falling asleep. I woke up and ate some more nibbles.

Not a bad day (it's funny how negativity is the standard...that is, a day is expected to be bad and it's worth noting if it's not). I hiked alone until I got tired of hiking alone, then waited for the others to catch up. For the rest of the day we all hiked together, talking and laughing and stopping at a shelter for lunch. On the way down to Palmerton, Boomerang fell hard with his 45 lbs. pack and busted his knee, so I gave him 6 ibuprofen and carried his pack the rest of the 8 miles into town. I parted wit the boys and hitched to the Fine Lodge in Slatington to grab a mail-drop. We'd meet in Palmerton that evening. It was 4:00. My ride was a boisterous dad with black sunglasses and a black sleeveless t-shirt driving a big shiny black SUV. He had two sons and was a big Steelers fan. The Fine Lodge was a strange place. Disheveled people milled about listlessly, and I wondered where they were headed in life. I waited about 45 minutes for the proprietor to give me a free ride to Palmerton, and ate all my Mom's brownies.
I dropped my pack in the hostel (the basement of the Police Station) and walked out to find the boys. I questioned some old ladies about their whereabouts ("I think they passed by. No they didn't. Wait, they did!"), a waitress who gave me a dirty look, a weird guy walking around with his shirt off, and several mentally-retarded guys sitting on a park bench (they couldn't really communicate, but I talked to them like they weren't disabled at all. I think ignoring their disability is the greatest gift a stranger can give the disabled) It was a strange town. I found the boys at a Pizza place. A guy pestered us and interrupted our conversation with stupid questions about hiking, and I told him I carried a pistol at all times.
That night I took a shower and slept alright. A flip-flopper named Biff was snoring terribly and keeping all of us awake (we were having a conversation about how bad it was as Biff snored on), so I woke him up and asked him to roll over. That did it and the rest of the night was soundless.

I had an early breakfast of a Farmer's Omelet at the diner before Duane the Pest Control Man shuttled us back to the trail head. The first ascent of the day as a near-vertical rock climb. Shocked my the ridiculous angle, Reckless paused to take a photo of me. We'd switched iPods because he wanted to hear the Into Thin Air audiobook. The next 8 miles traversed a mountainside leveled for zinc-mining many years before and still classified as a Superfund Site. It was strangely open and grassy and, in fact, prettier than the rest of PA. Several hours of fast and strong hiking brought us (Reckless, Boomerang, Muffin Mittens and I) to a grassy spot in the woods. I had a good conversation with Muffin Mittens about his 6 years of service in the U.S. Army. I took a nap and the group moved on. 
The naps multiplied as often do, and soon I was hours behind the group. I just didn't care. I made it to the shelter after a long and obnoxious night hike through some of the worst rocky sections we'd yet crossed. My feet were killing me.
Oh yea! And tonight we caught up with Fahma and Klipspringer. More on that later, but for tonight I slept well.

We awoke in the shelter shivering. It had been a cold night, and I was just warm enough to sleep. I didn't want to get out of my bag, but at last I unzipped and jumped to my feet. A quick pack-up and we hit the road to Unionville, some 27 miles away. The first several hours of hiking were pleasant. We stopped at a deli for a breakfast sandwich and coffee, then continued sleepily. Today we talked and joked happily, and the miles passed by quickly. For 2 hours I listened to Guns, Germs, and Steel on audiobook. Before I knew it, we were only 9 miles from Unionville, and Reckless did a commendable job keeping me awake. At one point, he saw I was dragging with sleepiness and screamed as loud as he could. The scream jerked me awake and I was fine for the rest of the day. I owe him one for that.
At the road, the hostel owner picked us up. "If you call me sir one more time I'm gonna hit you," he told Reckless. He was a hilarious guy, hilarious not in a clever way but in a ridiculous way. "We're gonna bust your balls," he said. "You get one free beer and the rest are 50 cents. You must take a shower. Dinner'll be ready soon so get showered quickly." He did a great job of making us feel at home, and that, he said, was his mission: "You see that sign by the door? It says, 'When you leave this home, you are friends.' The last word should be 'brothers,'" he said. He believed strongly in the verse: I am my brother's keeper, and I deeply respected him for it. In return, "We think what you guys are doing is f***ing stupid, but we respect you for it," he said. "The Mayor beleives in starting what you finnish."
the old guy cussing, visit to the grocery store, the video of britians got talent, finding out about kevin
It's 2:49 am, I'm dead tired, and the Mayor is getting us up at 6:30 tomorrow so I've got to cut this short. THanks for reading everyone. Until next entry.

Old Bill, the miserable cursing caretaker at the Mayor's House ("You wanna buy a house? It comes with a dishwasher. His name's Bill," said Butch) woke us up at precisely 6:30 for a breakfast of sausage, eggs and hashbrowns. I drank several cups of strong black coffee and scarfed down the food. Several hours later, Butch was driving us to the trailhead. The morning passed nicely through cool forests and warm fields. Before noon we stopped at a rocky overlook for a 20-minute snack break. We marched on.
As morning passed to afternoon, sleepiness came over me; still, I kept walking. By 4:00 I could barely walk out of weariness. Boomerang and Reckless tried in vain to keep me awake (we'd been hiking together all day), and I say with no exaggeration that it was the most tired I'd ever been. At last I collapsed on the trail for a 10-minute combat nap. The Georgia boys walked on. Within 30 minutes of awakening I caught up to cover the last 8 miles with them. The smooth blue of Greenwood Lake lay down in the valley, looking flat and pure against the patchy green-cottonball mountains. The lake was huge, perfect for sailing.
Greenwood Village, situated on the lake's shore and .9 miles from the AT, was a nice town. Kids played backyard ball and on playgrounds, filling the evening with the sounds of summer. "I'm feelin' that summer vibe," I told the Georgia boys, "and I like it." A guy gave us a lift to the Chinese Buffet in town, and after eating (I didn't eat much) walked over to the Linden Motel. Anticipating bad weather that night, we had arranged to sleep in the Linden's poolhouse for free. I bought a Snickers bar and went to sleep with knife in hand.

An Indian man stood at the side of the poolhouse, looking in. I got up to shake his hand and explain our being there. Luckily, it was the same manager who'd OK'd it earlier. We walked over to the gas station and I got a honeybun for breakfast, then walked down to a diner for another breakfast. It was a small pastry shop owned by a spunky middle-aged woman. I watched hwe and her assistant, a teenage girl, joke and carry on behind the counter. I asked them questions about their life and they willingly answered. Customers entered, grabbed their breakfasts-to-go, and exited. One customer stayed to eat, and I got to talking to her. Lisa was a local pet-sitter. As a local, she was very knowledgeable about the area's history and (to my delight) geology. We talked about local attitudes, the Rainbow Coalition, and hitching trains. Boomerang entered and got breakfast next to me. When she left, Lisa picked up both of our $5.00 tabs. She saif "God Bless" and left. Rain fell and the air was cold, and there was a silent consensus between the Georgia boys and I: we would wait a while before hiking.
Down at the library, I updated my journal and took a nap in a chair. I met Raury, a long-distance runner from Manhattan. He looked like your classic crazy black man bum and plague to the local library, but he spoke articulately like a Harvard scholar. He was big into long-distance running and had completed countless marathons. He offered to give us a ride anywhere we wanted. I took his phone number and walked to the pizza shop to meet the Georgia boys. The prettiest girl in the world was behind the counter. She smiled and asked me about the trip. I thought about her for the rest of the day. I called Raury and he took us to the trailhead. It was drizzling and cold.
It was already 1:00, a late start out of Greenwood Lakes. We marched 16-some miles into a beautiful state park, scrambling incredible rock faces and passing sleepy lakes. The park was teeming with wildlife--huge woodpeckers darting about, bushy squirrels bounding to trees, muscular deer staring at us, songbirds singing, and a great owl flappig silently away.
At the shelter, an ancient stone edifice with dual chimneys, we settled down for the night. Night fell and so did I into sleep.

Alot of highs today: Hiking in the morning through the state park (a meadowy open forest), hopping a 10-foot barbed-wire fence for water, seeing the zoo at Bear Mountain State Park, talking to the Sisters of Life nuns, getting a 101 lesson from a party of birdwatchers, crossing the Bear Mountain Bridge, drinking a Coors Light tallboy on the trail, talking in Spanish to an Ecuadorian store owner, and SEEING THE NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE! The sight of NYC was, by far, the most awe-inspiring thing I've yet seen. I almost lost my breath, like I'd just seen a miracle performed. I just couldn't beleive it: I simply cannot put into words the feelings I felt then.
Lows? Getting lost was frusterating (I missed Bear Mountain and crossed several almost-as-high peaks to the east, then hit the 1777 Trail that followed back to the State Park), and that night a queer Southbounder in the shelter snored incessantly.

Lows: my feet got serious blisters (not bloody but very close), finding Kevin at the shelter (an awkward situation given his denial of some unproven yet highly-probable section-skipping), and laboring to catch up after napping always sucks.

Highs: meeting up with Uncle Bill at the day's end was the climax of the day; I enjoyed meeting a group of young Brooklyners who had taken the day off from stressful city life. Seeing those kids really reawoke a nagging desire I have to move to NYC for a short time...it's so magical! The SUNSHINE! brought up the temps and made the day ideal for hiking; I enjoyed trail-running along a gentler trail than the day before; that night, Bill treatd the Georgia boys and I to wings, a reuben, a beer, AND desert at the Corner Pub. Bill also showed us his masterpiece, a year-long garage/workshop/office/guest house he built from scratch.OH YEA!- I saw the biggest oak on the AT! It was a beautiful monster (see the pic I found on the internet...No, that's not me in the photo) 
Lows: none to speak of. Honestly, I felt great today. My pack without food and water (its most common state, as I'm carrying only 1-2 days of food these days) is 12 lbs. at most makes the going easy for my joints, muscles, and most of all feet. I skip up hills and run down the backsides. On the contrary, the Georgia boys were hurting as usual (their packs are significantly heavier than mine).
A quick word on the spirit. Like I've said, the weather is dandy these days. The pain and misery has died down, yet so has the volume of the Lord's voice. I just don't hear God anymore like I used to, and I don't know whether to remedy the silence or embrace it for what it is. Maybe he's showed me what he wanted to show me - you know, demonstrated Truth - and now the ball is in MY court. Maybe I'm supposed to activate change. I don't know. But still, though I'm more faithful now thanks to the hardships of winter, I still long for those days. When I could really hear and feel him by my side.
Thanks everyone for reading this journal and for all your support! I'm currently at Mile 1,448 (only 731 from Katahdin!) and still can't beleive I've made it this far. Leave a comment in my "Guest Book"...it says almost 10,000 people have read my journal since last week so I'm kinda curious who exactly these 10,000 people are.

I was up and adam this morning before 6 o'clock, sitting upright and alert on the couch where I slept. I was thrilled to be so awake. If I had been in the woods, I decided, I'd be on the trail. The house was warm and kept out the chilly morning, a chilly morning that would've normally paralyzed me in my sleeping bag. A general law of hking: the colder the morning the slower the rise.
We all walked over to a diner for breakfast at 6:45 - Tom, the Georgia Boys and I. I spent $4.75 on the special (a heap of homefries, 2 eggs, toast and bottomless coffee) and a blueberry muffin that the waitress offered to "grill" (she brought it back blackened on both sides). I drank like five cups of coffee. Still out of money, the Georgia Boys spotted me on the bill.
Tom drove us 24 miles North to where the AT intersects Williamstown (from there, we would walk back to his home via the AT). For once freed from our backpacks, and weexpected to cover the 24 miles up and over Graylock Mountain with leisure and ease. I was quite angry thanks to yet another baffled attempt at recieving my maildrop in Williamstown, but I swallowed and decided to forget about it for the day. This day was sunny and mine, and neither dark clouds nor or stresses were about to ruin it. I felt fresh as we parted ways and began walking.
The 6-mile ascent to Graylock wasn't too bad. I sat at the top, spit sunflower seeds, and looked out across the most expansive view we'd seen for 500 miles. The view was mighty and powerful like a hammer, falling smooth yet strong. I don't know how to describe it, but it resonated inside and out.
For the rest of the day (the last 18 miles), I hiked alone. I ran sometimes, walked others, and just calmly took in the day. The colors were outstanding, confined to the greens, blues and browns of the forest yet somehow glowing in a million shades. I sat on a soft bed of moss and thought about how LIFE lay around me. The walls and metal and plastics of the home aren't alive-they don't live. But there's something profound about sitting with LIFe around you. You can almost feel it breathing.
Before 5 o'clock I arrived back in Dalton. I took a shower, a nap, and ate another excellent dinner prepared by Tom. A boiled medely of cabbage, carrots, and potatoes served with a salad, 2 cobs of corn and hot dogs. It was the first healthy meal I had in many weeks, and I gorged.

Three thirty-mile days into Rutland: that was my plan when Tom Levardi dropped me off at Massachusetts Rt. 2. It was 8:45 in the morning, and warm. I was alone and feeling fresh. Thirty miles lay ahead and I felt ready for them. The Georgia boys were about an hour behind.
At dusk, I lay at the foot of a mountain. I was hungry, very hungry. I had scant food supply and hunger had set in early that day, so by sunset I felt like a skeleton. Thirty miles and I had one more mountain to climb. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't believe I was this hungry.
A word on hunger: sometimes it sucks, sometimes it invigorates. For the affluent American, hunger is a negative state that usually occurs as an active choice that lasts, perhaps, for several short hours at the end of the day. In such cases, hunger is sought after. For relatively complacent Americans, a couple hours of monk-like discipline offers a hunger that makes one feel lean inside, potent, alive. But the pleasant sound of tummy-rumbles, coming just before a home-cooked meal after a long day at work, are invigorating yet entirely self-imposed. But the rumbles are not so pleasant when you're in the woods.
Hunger bears down upon me in the mountains. Hiking hungry is okay from time to time, but after a while it begins to feel urgent. It oppresses morale, dims the spirit, and weakens the body. And there's nothing I can do about it. It is hopelessly out of my control. This is true hunger, I believe, and there's no romanticism to be found. In summary, I now understand the animalism awakened by this persistent, maddening sort of hunger. Looking at video footage of starving people in Africa, all I can say is that I understand like I didn't before. I know how it feels to be truly hungry, at least for three days (the collapse on the mountain was Day 1 of 3).
Well, I made it to the shelter at the top of the mountain. There, a fire awaited me and, around it, three young guys drinking whiskey. I collapsed in the high grass. We exchanged glances. "You want some cheese and pepperoni, man?" I must have looked pretty bad. As the night wore on I drank whiskey and ate more cheese and pepperoni by the fire. Their names were Candyman, Bug Bite, and Clamspoon. Bug Bite said he was trapped in Vermont and that he was going to San Francisco to start over. I felt sort of inspired by that.

I got up early and took off before Candyman & Co. stirred. A short hike to the summit presented a tall fire-tower. I climbed it. At the top, the blue whisps of cloud raced by and a panoramic view flooded out in all directions. 
At the next shelter (Kidd Gore) I devoured a banana-nut bread Clif Bar. The sun was out strong and the view from the shelter was nice, so I hung around and continued eating (ripping into next day's bags). An hour later I'd eaten to the point of nausea and condemning myself to two days of constant hunger and begging along the trail. Self-control? At this point I have none.
At the next shelter (Story Spring) I waited for the Georgia boys. They'd started their day 8 miles behind me, but by 2:00 pm they'd caught up. For the next several hours I hiked with them. At the top of Stratton Pond Mountain, the fire-tower view was, without a doubt, the most beautiful view yet in 1,700 miles. I cannot describe it here, but I will remember it forever. The blues, the greens, the whites. The lakes, the forests, the peaks. It all rang out in the core.
I left the Georgia boys at the next shelter and moved on into the sunset. The bugs were terrible, so I was glad as night fell. My plan was to hike a 40-mile day, but I abandoned it for a 30 to Vermont Rt. 11. I fell asleep under the stars next to the highway.

I was on the trail at 6:00am. Actually, I fell asleep there so I never left the trail in the first place. I walked into the sunrise and to the top of Bromley Mountain, where I took in another spectacular view. The summit was claimed by the ski resort, so it was packed with lift machines, snow-blowing equipment, ski lodges and big ski trail signs. I walked into a small warming hut and called my dad on a phone there, then moved on.
It was a long and boring day, but I wasn't upset about it. I just walked. By 3:00 I'd covered 20 miles, and I weighed my three options: another 10 before dusk to make 30, or another 20 into the night to make 40, or another 30 into the early morning to make a record of 50 miles. The 50-miler was almost out of the question, the 40-miler would be a push in itself, and the 30-miler my conservative plan. I was hungry to exhaustion as I walked the next 10-mile leg, and when I got to the shelter at sunset I mulled over moving on. A Long Trail thru-hiker offered me food and I kicked off my boots. Once the belly was full and feet free, that was that. I called it a day at 30.
One interesting change in the forest was the morph from New England hardwoods into a boreal forest. The forest felt like a cathedral, echoing with birds and spacey for nearly a hundred yards in every direction. There were trees, yes--old hemlocks, spruces, and firs--but no shrubbery choking the understory. It was all open and cast blue in the shade. It smelled of Christmas, and red squirrels darted about. The hiking hurt but the scenery was incredible.

Today took me up and over Mount Killington on a beautiful trail cloaked in hemlocks and firs. The sun was brutal, but not in the shade of the forest. I was almost sure I had giardia, and my abs cramped and I stopped to relieve myself all the way up. I didn't eat but a couple granola bars until walking down to the VT 4 highway. I waved a bus down and jumped on. Rutland at last!
I slept for most of the 20-minute bus ride, but entering the city I awoke. Beautiful old stone churches graced almost every corner, and, on this Friday afternoon, people walked and rode bikes on the sidewalk. It was an enlivening scene. I envied the town life.
I got off the bus and walked over to the Back Home Again Cafe, where I was greeted by an enthusiastic bearded man. He led me upstairs to the hostel and I opened my mail-drop. The contents were: 4 days of food, the Spot GPS, a cell phone + charger, an iPod charger, a camera + USB cord, a pair of Nike shoes, and 2 loaves of homemade banana bread. I grabbed a foil-wrapped loaf and went down to the cafe. I stared at it for a while--I'd been looking forward to this moment for a long time--then peeled back the foil. Inside, mold covered the bread. "Oh well. Just looking at it is enough," I said to "H", the bearded owner who'd sat down next to me. He jumped up and grabbed a muffin at the counter. "Take this. It's not Mom's, but it was baked this morning."
I got a Reuben and a beer from next door and made some phone calls on the street--Rawlz, Diesel, Seth, Wesley, Corey, Mom & Dad. Suddenly, I was surrounded by four bearded men with ponytails. "Wanna come to our gathering?" "If I can get my Reuben in a to-go box," I replied. I got in the car with them The Twelve Tribes is a denomination of Christianity that practices many Amish-like customs with a hippie attitude, and a small community of them owned and operated the Back Home Again Cafe. Men wear beards, women wear dresses, and multiple families all live under the same roof, and, honestly, that's the only real difference between us and them. They took me back to their homes--they'd bought up a small cluster of old houses less than a mile from the cafe--and witnessed their 'gathering'. Everyone stood in a circle quietly. In this informal setting, some shared spiritual revelation and others recounted a enlightening experiences from that day--for example: "It was a sunny day and I was listening to a woman complain to her husband on the cell phone, and it hit me how much we worry ourselves about what's not the present." They sang a song and let me go. I went to the library and read up on giardia, and a strange man approached me as I munched on my Reuben outside. "This town is bad, man. Watch out at night," he said.
It was getting late and I walked to Wal-Mart. I bought a bar of dark chocolate and a gatorade, then walked over to the movie theater. The guy at the counter wouldn't charge me for a ticket, so I just walked in kind of confused. Shrek was boring, and when I woke up the theater was all black and the movie over. I walked back to the hostel and went to sleep.

Today was my half-zero day in Rutland, and here's what I did: I got up early and packed my pack, received an early breakfast of 3 eggs, toast, and granola with milk, then did three hours of work-for-stay. In the kitchen I peeled bananas, cored tomatoes, sliced peppers, washed dishes, and mopped/swept the floor. I was actually pretty enjoyable because I got to talk to H, the quirky manager.
After the work-for-stay, H ordered me a free smoothie and I walked over to the movie theater to see Robin Hood! I was so excited, and got a pint of Ben & Jerry's for the occassion. As I expected the movie was AWESOME, and I thought about it all that evening as I walked in the woods to the Stony Brook Shelter to meet the Georgia Boys. On the 10-mile march, I hung up my old boots on a large birch tree next to a huge boulder by a lake. In case I ever go back to Rutland, I'll come for them. It wasn't hard leaving Rutland, but it wasn't easy either. The folks there were so kind and the town itself so pretty and lively. Something tells me I'm going to always regret leaving places like Rutland before even getting to know them. At any rate, in the dark I trudged into the Stony Brook Shelter and hit the sack. Back in the woods again...

I needed it, so today I lounged in the shelter while everyone else moved on. For nearly two hours I dozed in perfect silence, read Call of the Wild, and walked about the clearing. Eventually I hit the dusty trail, but my pace was slow all day. I just couldn't get "into it," and stopped again and again to sit on stumps and eat. By dusk, I hadn't even covered 20 miles! I didn't want to hike in the dark (and couldn't tolerate the overly-talkative fellow in the shelter), so I laid out my sleeping bag on the trail and fell asleep. The next morning I planned to rise before 6 and catch up with the Georgia Boys in the next shelter. I had dreams of alligators...

Slackpacking on Moose Mtn.









Accepting charity is always a tricky thing to on and off the trail. My mantra is always "Just say yes; they're offering it for a reason," but the Georgia boys take a more shy and reserved approach. For example, when I'm sitting in the kitchen at Bob Boon's house and Bob says, "Help yourself to anything in the fridge," I have no qualms with pouring myself a glass of OJ; contrarily, the Georgia boys would take the offer as an empty formality and sit still. I can't say which is the best approach--one must be virtuous and the other not--but as I accumulate encounters with 'Trail Magic' I'm beginning to see myself as a sly beggar, a beggar with instincts trained to exploit the kindhearted. In a word, the trail has turned me into a dirty hobo with an insatiable appetite for mooching.

It was Sunday, and after enjoying Bob's breakfast (bacon-and-egg biscuts, doughnuts, bananas, and OJ), Bob drove us to the trail. We left his care and hit the trail, aiming for a shelter 9 miles away (Reckless had spent all night in the ER, so we shortened the day). I took my time like I do sometimes, taking long and frequent breaks to snack, nap, or just stare at the sky. I enjoyed an especially long lunch at the foot of the fire tower on Smarts Mtn., and the Georgia Boys went on far ahead. At the 9-mile shelter (Hexacube), I left a note and kept walking. "Onto Glen Cliffs for the night (signed) UF," it read. And that I did, stopping at another shelter halfway to convince Sore Foot to accompany me into the night. Sore Foot and I marched on a difficult night-hike marked only by nearly stumbling over a porcipine. We arrived at 11:20 pm at the Hikers Welcome Hostel. I ate a poptart and drank a soda before bed (as dinner I'd skipped), and took a deep breath for Moosilauke the following day.

Mount Moosilauke









Hey everyone! Sorry for the belated entries, but here's the next installment in Uncle Frank's trek to Maine...
My feet were sore so I lounged the next morning at the Hikers Welcome Hostel, watching the news over coffee and chatting with the hostelliers. At 10:45, I hit the trail up Mt. Moosilauke (the hurdle of the infamous White Mountains) on fuel of 3 poptarts and 3 cups of coffee to match. In shelter sitting at the foot of Moosilauke, I found an old baseball to carry to Mt. Washington. Up the backside of Moosilauke I flew, stopping only once to provide isopropyl and medical tape for a lady who took a nasty spill on the rocks. Soon I was on top, standing in awe by the sign (Mt. Moosilauke 4802 ft). Here was the most beautiful thing I'd witnessed for 1,900 miles. I laughed like a lunatic, holding back the yips and yells that would've come out HAD so many day-hikers not shared the summit. I ate some sunflower seeds, a woman took my photo, and I tip-toed down the steep backside of the mountain. A beautiful stream cascaded down parallel to the trail, emitting a sweet-smelling mist. I ascented the next hurdle (name?), and the next, and encountered a memorably-painful three miles leading up to the Lonesome Lakes Hut. I'd covered 23 miles, a suprising feat given the terrain. The summits here are steep, unforgiving, leg-burning and calorie-sapping monsters, and their peaks demand a high-fee of pain for their spectacular views.
It was dark when I knocked on the hut at Lonesome Lakes. Yellow light glowed inside, and I could soo several croo-members playing cards. One opened and I asked for some shelter in exchange for labor. Yes, they had some work-for-stay, so I entered and kicked off my shoes as the hutmaster gave me a huge can of cold beans with a spoon in it. A perfect dinner. I walked down to the lake for a bath. The night was clear and starry. The water was cool and black. I stripped down and flushed the sweat, blood, spider-webs and dead blackflies off my body. It felt so good to be clean. I walked back to the bunkhouse and collapsed into bed. An perfect end to an perfect day.

After making beds and organizing a food pantry, I bagged some granola/Lucky Charms and took a nap. By 11:00 (another late start), I was packed and on the trail. To Galehead Hut I marched, and the weather was nasty. Rain drizzled and poured, and winds blew hard. On the famed Franconia Ridge the views were all white-out (a minor disappointment). It was cold, windy, and wet above the tree-line, and I was miserable. I couldn't wait to get off the ridge and down to the forest. As I trudged I thought about the two-faced nature of this well-known ridge. It was either a maiden or a monster, either a cold and cloud-covered forced-march or a balmy cake-walk with spectacular views. The difference was a single day. Down at Galehead Hut, the croo served me warm soup and homemade pizza. I chatted with a very pretty girl (yea, that's a big deal). I couldn't believe the hospitality, and I fell asleep that night thinking, "I could get used to this." A perfect end to a not-perfect day.

Dusk on Mt. Franklin









"Redemption?": That was the first word out of my mouth that morning, spoken as I peered out of the window into beaming morning light. Believe it or not, the rain had moved out overnight and all clouds were gone. I layed out my wet gear in the sunlight to dry, and sat down at a set table for a croo-served breakfast of coffee and hot oatmeal with brown sugar, walnuts, strawberries, raisins, and apples. "No Brains", a warm-hearted section-hiker on his second-to-last leg, shared my complete awe of croo's degree of hospitality. We took turns singing praise to the croo, trying to convey gratitude that they would never understand in full. I scarfed down the breakfast and walked out to forage sticks to the compost, washed some dishes, and threw my pack on. It was 8:45, and off I marched to Lakes of the Clouds Hut, 26 miles away.
The sun was beaming and each peak, one after another, grew higher and grander and more majestic than the last, until I was standing at sunset on Mt. Franklin. I stopped then, looking out as the heavens lay opened before me. It brought tears to my eyes, this most perfectly-beautiful place in the world. There's something about windy peaks that strikes a chord deep in the soul of man. Why can't a dense green forest strike it too? Perhaps, it's the feeling of nakedness of a mountaintop, where it's too high for those wordly distractions to grow. There it's pure, like life was meant to be. Up on those high-alpine peaks, perhaps we "haunted by the echoes of Eden."
I descended down to the Lakes of the Clouds Hut, posted at the foot of Mt. Washington, the infamous jewel of the White Mountains crown. It was balmy and clear out, but ominous clouds engulfed the mountain, covering the peak from view.

Gritting my Teeth on Mt. Washington









The next morning I awoke in The Dungeon, where the Lakes of th Clouds croo had put me up for the night. Just to give you an idea of what 'The Dungeon' implied, I'll simply say that the place was damper and smellier than my feet. Forecasts said the rain would blow over by 8am, so I awoke about that time. Dense fog cloaked the mountain and reduced visibility to zero, but the rains held off. Considering the ornery temperment of Mt. Washington, I decided weather was good enough to climb. So, I drank a protein shake and hit the trail at 7:45.
The ascent was just as perilous as I expected. Visibility was near-zero, allowing just enough room to see from one mound of rocks to the next. All else was cloud. Wind speeds picked up as the rock mounds led up and up and up, soon strong enough to blow me off the trail. The terrain was 100% rocks. No vegetation dared grow. After 30 minutes of climbing I made out the shape of a mighty tower. I passed the tower, passed some buildings, and finally I was standing on the summit of Mount Washington, the high-point of AT-traversing past North Carolina. It snapped a photo and went inside the lodge (that's right, one of east-coast mountaineering's most covetted peaks has a yuppie LODGE on top, complete with Snickers, Sodas, and Hot Dogs...all of which I purchased). I hung out in the lodge for several hours, journaling and eating junk food in the warmth. At about noon I descending, taking a 7-mile short-cut around Mt.Adams, J.Q. Adams, and Madison because of the weather. It was a nasty day at the home of the worst weather in America, and I was eager to get down into the valley. At about 3pm, I arrived at Pinkham's Notch and hitched into Gorham. There, I got a bunk at the hostel and picked up a maildrop from home. Oh, Mom's muffins...

Bedding on Doc's porch









 At first light I was on my feet, as has been the case lately. I walked over to grab a muffin and Gatorade at the convenience store, then dined on my way back. It was warm out, sign of another gorgeous day in the White Mountains. I threw my pack on my back and strolled down for some caffeine stimulus before the library opened at 10 o'clock. The waitress smiled and moved excitedly about the cafe. At ten I entered the library and opened a tab for computer use at a dollar/half-hour (theft, in my opinion). At noon I grudgingly paid the clerk after almost three hours of updating trail journals and writing emails. "I bet yall make a fortune off hikers needing to use your computers," I said bitterly and left. Outside, a quick hitch to Pinkham Notch and I was on the trail.
The trail was sunny and I took a nap on a couch in a ski patrol hut ontop Wildcat Mountain. Then, I descended to the Carter Notch Hut for a swim in the lake and a nature lesson from the hut's croo ("Friendly fir, spiny spruce," I learned). I had no gear, so I had to decline the hutmaster's offer for a meal and overnight stay. "I'll be back for the hut experience one day," I told him. I moved on. By evening I was back in town, devouring a foot-long sub after a hard day in the mountains. With permission, I bedded down on "Doc's" front porch as rain began to fall.

At 4 o'clock the next morning, I bought a ham-and-egg sandwhich, a honey bun, and some OJ at the convenience store, and as I packed my gear to go, a torrential rain began to fall. I cursed under my breath (visibe in the cold air, by the way), unrolled my sleeping bag, and went back to sleep. So much for a 5 o'clock start.
At 7:30, I walked over for pancakes, bacon, and eggs, hoping that huge breakfast would somehow make the rain not-so-wet. I ate heartily and enjoyed it thoroughly. I've become the skinniest food glutton you've ever seen. I loved the waitresses New York accent.
It took a while to get a hitch, but soon I was at the trailhead. After a frustrating episode trying to nap in a fog of mosquitoes and blackflies, I was on the trail at noon, moving towards the Full Goose Shelter 20 miles to the north. I ambled along lazily, not really wanting to be there but not really dissatisfied either. Just bored. I ate too much and found myself hiding in a shelter 10 miles short of Full Goose. A 70 year-old fellow named Grump really irritated me by talking my ear off. "If I'm talking too much, it's because I was a minister," he said. He was still talking as I drifted off to sleep.

This morning, I waited. But the rain never left, and into the afternoon it still poured. I was paralyzed, I discovered, by an element not yet encountered: rain. I'd mastered snow and heat, but rain? I shuddered. Let me add also that this was not a warm summer shower; this was cold Maine rain. Hours passed quickly sitting in the shelter, sleeping and eating off and on, and soon it was 5 o'clock in the evening. At last, it was calm out. The rain had subsided. I risked it and moved on to the next shelter, only to have the rain start again. By the time I arrived at Carlo Col, I was soaked and shivering. Unfortunately, the shelter was packed like a refugee camp with AMC trainees. I told one I was going to Acadia with my family. "You're going to Acadia?!?", one exclaimed. "I'm already planning a trip on my next day off! And they have the best lobster!" I laughed and tried to bring my mind out of the cold and wet and into the future, done with the trail and with my family in Acadia.

Morning view the way down to Rangely









 I was out of the smelly, noisy shelter early. Up the first several ridged I climbed, cursing at the wind and cold. I felt like I was right back in the Smokies. It was all clouds, but at the top of one ridge I saw the sun glowing through. Suddenly it pierced through. The clouds broke and scattered, and I was surrounded by sweet blue sky. A panoramic view of rolling green mountains and cerulean lakes filled my eyes. Redemption! Still shivering, I called home to share the news. They said Corey was in the ICU, which re-clouded my sunny day. I'd been screaming with excitement; now I was silent and subdued. It hit me hard how far I was from home, how I'd let my family go in a big way. Homesickness swelled inside. 
Mahoosuc Notch was tricky, but it wasn't the dangerous mile of life-threatening bouldering I expected. I just kind of hopped through like a monkey. After Mahoosuc I made my way to the next road, where Earl from "The Cabin" waited for me in his pick-up. We met and he took me back to his home. I showered, laundered my clothes, changed into a clean set, and sat down for a dinner of grilled salmon, scallops, corn-on-the-cob, baked potatoes, and red wine. It was one of those meals I'll never forget. I cooked some maple-syrup pancakes (to take on the trail the next day) with some flour and syrup I found in a shelter the day before. I watched a movie on VHS (always a treat) and went to bed past midnight. It was the most comfortable night in recent memory.

A hard climb made worth it...Summit of N. Crocker Mtn.









 At 5:00 AM, Earl woke me up to leave. He dropped me back at the trail by 6:30 and I was off up the first mountain. It was bitterly cold, and it became dangerously cold as I ascended. Up and up and up the trail went, following nearly a mile along the mountain's exposed rocky ridgeline to its summit. I froze up there in my t-shirt and shorts. It was the lowest moment of the trip since that snowy day on Derrick's Knob in the Smokies. It was just so damn cold. After what seemed like hours I descended back into the trees, almost incredulous as to what just happened.
I caught up with the Georgia boys and hiked with them to the Bemis Mountain Lean-to. It was a hard day, but then again every day is a hard day so I had nothing to complain about. There was laughing and there was complaining, as usual. I found web-like mold in my dinner and had to throw it out (I'd found it in a hiker box from last year, so I can't say I was surprised).

One of Maine's ten million lakes









The next day was a pleasant one, down into the small town of Rangely, Maine. We passed some pretty lakes, and seeing the lapping water made me miss home. I brought my right back to sailing the Hobie with the family in the Bay. By 2:00 we were at the road, trying to hitch. We waited, thumb out, for almost two hours. I'd all but given up on humanity when an ambulance pulled over. "Hop on in!," said the paramedic. All three of us boarded for a 10-minute ride into Rangely. I was faint with hunger, and consumed a beer and small pizza in several minutes. At Bob's Hostel, I ate 6 eggs, 2 apples, 2 oranges, and blackberries. The healthiest gorge ever. I went to bed late that night, again up making pancakes for the next day's rations.

The ferry over the Kennebec









What a day! It was only 4 o'clock, and it was dim out. But the morning summer light was growing as it does these days, permitting an early start on the trail. Out here, I've never seen the sun so wild. It sets later and rises earlier than it does living inside, and this morning I noticed its faint glow lighting up the sky well before my 4 o'clock departure. I guess I know the sun better than I used to.
At 5:45 I arrived at the Pierce Pond Shelter and took a 5-minute blue-blaze trail to Harrison’s Camp, home to Harrison’s infamous 12-pancake breakfast. It was still dim and the place was silent, so I walked inside and passed out on a couch. I would’ve marched on for sake of time, but I needed this breakfast—those 12 pancakes would get me 40 miles to Monson by that night. By 9:30 I was, at last, stuffed with sausage, eggs, and twelve blueberry, apple, and cranberry pancakes (honestly, I was surprised at the feat). I moved swiftly on to the ferry at the Kennebec River.
At the river bank, loons cooed and disappeared underwater. I made a “skalooo” sound, and heard a “skaloo” back from the woods across the river. A man with a straw hat pulled a canoe from the tree-line and paddled across. “Hillbilly Joe” was his name, owing perhaps to his missing teeth. “Thanks for the ferry, man!” I exclaimed enthusiastically. “That’s what I’m here for,” he replied. Across the river, I kept walking.
The day passed by under sunny skies. Yeah, it hurt, but I was in the mood to hike. Also, the terrain was mild at last. Nervous that darkness would fall before I arrived in Monson (I had no headlamp), the whole day I kept checking my coordinates, counting my mileage and calculating my pace.
Near sunset, I stopped in a shelter to ask for a headlamp. Perhaps, I figured, I could buy one off a hiker with an extra (a fat chance, right?). Unfortunately, none of the 4 hikers had one. As I went to leave, I heard “wait a minute…I might actually have one.” Believe it or not, he did! I almost kissed the guy. Back on the trail, I found two little boxes of raisins! Then a spring to fill my bottle! I knew it was just good luck but, deep down, God was looking out for me. 
Into the night I hiked. At mile 34, five outside Monson, I hit my limit and crashed at a shelter to rest.

The night had been a long one, buzzing relentlessly with the sound of mosquitos. I was up all night, thanks to a new sting on my face or neck every five minutes, but by 3:00 the cold and rain arrived and suppressed the mosquitos. So, for an hour, I slept.
At 4 o'clock I was up and packing my things. "This is it," I repeated in my head. "Don't get scared now" (that's a line from Home Alone). I hit the trail by 4:37, moving swiftly up and up and up into the end of this horrible trek. The terrain was as difficult as I expected (Katahdin is widely believed to be THE hardest peak on the entire AT), but to be honest I made quick work of the 5.2 miles to the summit. My stomach cramped with hunger and my legs burned with lactic build-up. I felt like Edmond Hillary ascending up the final cornice, the "Hillary Step," but like Hillary it went quickly. "A push and a shove and Tenezig and I were on the top of the world," Hillary wrote later.
So there I was, standing at that godforsaken sign, wind whipping and white cloud shrouding the peak. I showed little emotion--in fact, I showed none. I just stood there, looking at the sign. I didn't feel like anything important was going on, nor that I'd accomplished any sort of feat. I nodded to myself and walked down the mountain. At the bottom, a day hiker asked me my name. "Uncle Fra-," I began to say. But it was all over--the trail had expired and my trail name with it--so I smiled and said, "Ford. Ford Prior."
