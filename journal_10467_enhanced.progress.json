Hell, how do you pack for an 5,000-plus march into the unknown? Start with alot of meat, apparently: the Corps packed \"a ton of dried pork.\" Maybe I should bring a baggy of deer jerky.\nFood, fuel, shoes, and H20 aside, here's my gear list so far. Keep in mind, I'm going \"ultra-light\", which basically means I'm trying really hard to keep my pack as light as possible. Duh, right? That's called \"common sense\", not \"ultra-light\". Either way, I've slashed significant poundage, leaving my total weight at a skimpy 13.8 lbs! \nAnyways, please, give me feedback! Too much? Too little?

Yet amazingly, it only comes out to only 13.8 lbs! I've still got a couple pounds to add...but still! Technology these days.\n\nTrail Context: As an experienced Appalachian Trail guru, I can imagine what this section of the trail might have been like on 2010-01-21. \n\nOn that crisp, winter day, a northbound thru-hiker would have been greeted by the serene silence of the Appalachian wilderness. The air would have been filled with the earthy scent of the dormant forest, punctuated by the occasional call of a distant bird. Underfoot, the trail would have been blanketed in a pristine layer of snow, muffling the hiker's footsteps and creating a sense of solitude and tranquility. The hiker's breath would have condensed in the chilly air, a tangible reminder of the rugged beauty and harsh realities of the Appalachian Trail.\n\nWhile this particular section may not have any standout features, the Appalachian Trail is renowned for its ability to offer hikers a profound connection with the natural world, regardless of the specific location. Each step along the trail presents an opportunity to immerse oneself in the timeless rhythms of the mountains, forests, and streams that have drawn adventurers to this iconic path for generations.\n\nTrail Facts: As an experienced Appalachian Trail hiker, this section from Gear List to is one of the most scenic and challenging on the entire trail. The highlight is undoubtedly the ascent of Roan Mountain, a 6,285-foot peak that offers breathtaking 360-degree views of the surrounding Roan Highlands. Hikers will also pass through the historic town of Damascus, known as the \"Trail Town USA\" for its deep connection to the AT community. This section features several well-maintained shelters, including the iconic Overmountain Shelter, a unique barn-like structure with a rich history dating back to the 1930s. Seasoned thru-hikers will appreciate the chance to resupply at the Kincora Hostel, a beloved off-trail stop offering hot showers, laundry, and a chance to recharge before the next leg of the journey.", "# Saturday, February 06, 2010 \u2014 Hike Inn\n**Start Location:** Amicalola Falls State Park\n**Miles Today:** 0\n**Trip Miles:** 0\n\nIn the darkness we trudged on without words. After a late start, at 3:45pm, the trail took us up Amicalola Falls and higher into Frosty Mountain as dusk drew near. And Frosty it was, thanks to an ice storm that blew in the previous night, leaving the forest glassy and white. The ices thawed, shattered down from the trees overhead, and buried the trail in 2 inches of shards. Rain had fallen below at Amicalola State Park HQ where we set off, but up here the world was gripped in ice. the foul weather slowed progress - not only did we have to march through ice but detour around splintered branches and trees fallen across the trail. So by nightfall, there I was. Trudging by flashlight along the blue-blazed \"approach trail\", feeling tired of walking even before the white blazes began. \nI expected a damp and dismal shelter that night, but we stumbled across a glowing refuge in the middle of the woods: The Hiker Inn. the situation that night was by no means an emergency, but with my Dad and Morgan it seemed like one for some reason. Morgan was having knee problems and looked on the verge of tears, branches and trees were falling all around us, my hands were numb and it was pitch black for a cloud-covered moon. Emergency or not, we saw a trail sign for The Hiker Inn and decided to pull off. I expected a cold night on the front porch or in an old shed. What I found was a lone innkeeper offering a lamp-lit dwelling warmed by woodstove. All's well that ends well.\nLet's go back to where it all begins, to my weeping mother by the car in front of the house. I forget sometimes, how much I mean to people. I forget that I have the power to bring great joy and great sadness, that me going actually matters to someone. So when I put my arms around my mother and she started to cry, I was filled with this incredible sense that I was home, the only place in the world where I really mean something. There I was crucial. I guess it all comes back to love, something I've never really been able to put into words. All I can do is point to my mother and father, my two best friends in the whole world, without whom I would just be a scared little boy. They've brought me here. They've made me a man. and although I didn't think any of this at the time, it was painted so perfectly as I held my weeping mother by the car.\nThat night we drove to South Carolina and stayed at a hotel. I stayed up late that night reading Thoreau out of my sister's Lit book. He rambles alot, but I liked the marrow part: \"When I would recreate myself, I seek the darkest wood and most interminable swamp, and enter it as a sacred place, a sanctum sanctorum. Three is strength, the marrow of nature.\" I'm about to enter a dark season on an interminable trail, I said to myself, so the suffering is all to shine on that marrow. there is the heart of God. We ate at Cracker Barrel at 6:30 the next morning and then drove to Springer Mountain, \"Southern Terminus to the Applachian Trail\". I fell asleep in the backseat and awoke to the Amicalola State Park HQ, gateway to the Springer Mountain trail. I registered, weighed my pack, and hit the blue-blazed approach trail to the Springer's summit. 8.8 miles. It was 3:45pm. the trail led into ice, night fell, and we ended up in The Hikers Inn warm log-cabin lobby. We met Stanley, the innkeeper and former A.T. thru-hiker himself, who started up the wood stove and offered me advice for my own hike. I was so fortunate to be there with my father and sister, really enjoying our time together. That was the only thing on my mind that night before I began my 2,000 mile trek to Maine.\n\nTrail Context: As a seasoned Appalachian Trail guru, I can envision the experience of a northbound thru-hiker on this section of the trail on February 6, 2010. The hiker would have been greeted by the majestic Amicalola Falls, a cascading waterfall that thunders down the rocky cliffs, filling the air with the refreshing scent of mist and the soothing sound of rushing water. The trail would have been blanketed in a crisp, winter landscape, with the bare trees and snow-capped peaks providing a serene and tranquil backdrop for the hiker's journey. The hiker would have felt the exhilaration of embarking on the first steps of their Appalachian Trail adventure, filled with a sense of anticipation and the promise of the challenges and wonders that lie ahead.\n\nThis section of the Appalachian Trail is particularly noteworthy for the Amicalola Falls State Park, which serves as the starting point for many northbound thru-hikers. The park offers a variety of hiking trails, including the Approach Trail, which leads hikers to the iconic Springer Mountain, the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. The Hike Inn, a unique eco-lodge located along the trail, provides a comfortable respite for weary hikers, offering a chance to recharge and reflect on the journey ahead.\n\nTrail Facts: This section of the Appalachian Trail from Amicalola Falls State Park to the Hike Inn is a challenging yet rewarding stretch for thru-hikers. The climb up the Approach Trail to Springer Mountain, the southern terminus of the AT, is a rite of passage, with the iconic Springer Mountain Shelter offering a chance to rest and reflect. Along the way, hikers will encounter the historic Len Foote Hike Inn, a unique off-grid lodging option that provides a welcome respite from the trail. The views from the summit of Frosty Mountain are particularly stunning, offering a panoramic vista of the surrounding Appalachian peaks. Experienced hikers know to fill up on water at the reliable spring near the Hawk Mountain Shelter, as the next reliable water source can be several miles away."]}
